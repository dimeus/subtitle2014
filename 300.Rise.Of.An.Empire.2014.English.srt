1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,610
The orecle's words stand as a warning.

2
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,610
A prophecy

3
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,610
Spartans will fall.

4
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,000
All of Greece will fall.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,200
And percian fire reduce athens to tinder.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
for athene it's a pile of stone and wood and cloth and dust.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and as dust will vanish into the wind.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
only athenians themselves exist.

9
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:30,000
And the fate of the world hangs on their every thinekle.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
only the athenians exist.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and only ***** wooden ships can save them.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
wooden ships...and tidal wave of heroes' blood.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Lienidus is my husband.

14
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,000
And he is your king.

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Lienidus and brave three hundred are dead.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
war is not their love
yet he lay down his life for them.

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,000
for the promise that greece holds.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It is our enemy who forged our freedom in fires of war.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It was our king Darius who came to take our land.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
before this bitter war forced our children to become men.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ten years ago
this war began.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
as all wars begin with the grivens.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Marothon.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,600
The percian king -Darius

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,000
annoyed by notion of greek freedom.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This came to geece to bring us to heal.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He makes landfull field of marothon with in waving fools which have numbers of greek defendents three to one.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
so what ****** hope athenian to do the unthinkable

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,900
They attack.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They attack the very percian ****** their ships and shaky legs a month at sea.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
They attack they establish their warcam and supply their soldiers.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And who is the arcitech of this mass strategy?

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
A little known athenian soldier..

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
his men called him ''the mistic ****''.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He gives the percians the taste of athenian's shock combat.

36
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,879
all thoughts of glory are gone.

37
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,934
<i> thousands dead ,
hundreds of them on their own </i>

38
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:22,584
<i> all for an idea,a free greece.
</i>

39
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,757
an athenian experiments called democrocy.

40
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:33,327
could this idea be worth it?worth all this sacrifice.

41
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:38,668
<< >>
Themistocles would let the good King Darius decide
</i>

42
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:44,938
<i>for through the
chaos,
a moment appeared </i>

43
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:51,118
Themistocles would seize it.

44
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:03,761
a moment that would ring across a centuaries,

45

the moment that would raise him from a simple soldire

46
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:10,678
to the hieght of the athenian political power.

<i> A moment that make Themistocles a legend.

yet even of the glory heat upon him.

49
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:44,790
Themistocles knew in his heart he'd made a mistake.

His eyes have the stinks of destiny about them.

Themistocles knew he should've killed that boy.

53
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:00,660
that gloriest mistake would forever haunt him.

54
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:11,636
as though it's the Themistocles who sent the ripper across the persian empire.

55
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:17,275
<i> and set into motion forces that would bring fires to the heart of the greece.

This is a democracy, not a street fight

- city *** should negotiate a truce.
- Yes, yes we must negotiate.

My fellow country men,we can only judge
the future.

Do not be deceived.

126

Xerxes, son of Darius is a wolf at our door.

127
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:32,376
right here right now.

128
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,469
We must choose Do we stand fight for greece or not.

129
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:37,638
Akragas...

130
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:42,047
Corinth, Megara, Athens...

131
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,296
not even Sparta can marched the percian alone.

132
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,921
we must **** as one nation.

133
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:51,834
or we will perish clean onto our own self intrests.

134
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,427
send us the ships that we need to defend greece.

135
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:59,132
Themistocles would need more than our shitty ships.

136
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,186
He'll need our children to join the fight.

137
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:08,204
- What of Sparta?
- Send every ship that we have,

138
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:10,567
to the north coast of Evia.

139
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,957
I'll go and seek the help.

140
00:15:13,992 --> 00:15:15,775
in the great Sparta...

141
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:40,721
Still no word from the messenger you sent to Sparta.

142
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:45,128
King Leonidas may have been insulted by your generous offer.

143
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:49,280
perhaps we need to march sparta myself and burn into the ground.

144
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,723
Remember...when a king is loveed*****

145
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,781
a much can be accomplished.

146
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:03,227
He will be forced to resist my divine power.

147
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:06,139
Athens is attempting to assemble a coalition.

148
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,953
It will be nothing more than bunch work of a ships.

149
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:14,823
...

150
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:20,885
how we remind ******  that we have not forgotten.

151
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:34,406
rest the horses.it's best i go alone.

152
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:38,241
Spartans do not get along well with us.

153
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:32,560
- Sparta...
- Themistocles...

154
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:36,321
what brings you to the sparta?

155
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,760
I've come to see Leonidas to warn him Persian are in the march
.

156
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:44,002
well you are too late.
Persian massenger already presented these terms to the Leonidas.

157
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:47,853
A symbolic offer to the land and water.

158
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:59,309
Spartan,know this and know this well.

159
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:02,649
It ain't spata's finest moments.

160
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:06,714
the greatest fullfilment that all he holds dear,

161
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:12,845
is that moment.

162
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:16,963
lies dead on the battlefield,

163
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:19,417
victorious.

164
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:26,000
now.who's willing to die at our king side?

165
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,884
Themistocles...

166
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,136
you've come a long way to stroke your cock to watch real men
train.

167
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:42,668
queen Gogra.shouldn't you be traing them to live at their king side?

168
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,128
A new age is downing over.

169
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,037
that sounds like a treat.
- No. ..

170
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:58,932
an opertunity to join over the rest free greeks to stand against the *****.

171
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:03,003
Unless of cause you and Leonidas had already made a deal with Xerxes.

172
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:10,162
exept Xerxes's messenger,but he was rude without respect.

173
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:14,821
he didn't notice same treats do not work here.

174
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:18,524
This is the birthplace of world's greatest warriors
.

175
00:19:19,436 --> 00:19:23,383
the men who's king would stand and fight for any one of them.

176
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:29,078
exept he's massengerdid not understand that this is no typical Greek city state.

177
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:34,476
This is Sparta.

178
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:39,283
so it was clear to the massenger,there would be no spartans on this mission.

179
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:43,876
It was clear.Even now Leonidas
has encouncel with oracle over his battle plan.

180
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,857
Festival of the carne stands in our way.

181
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,900
Surely oracle will see we must fight.

182
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,864
When the timing is perfect.

183
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:55,463
I am commanding *** of ships representing
united greece.

184
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:57,599
I want sparta to join me.

185
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,700
Give me your ship
Gorgo and I will make sure that Xerxes

186
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,294
wishes he would never crosses the edge again.

187
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:06,931
You will receive no Spartan ship.
We are not interested in united greece.

188
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:09,064
That is your dream, Themistocles,
not ours.

189
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:13,371
all i concered with preservation of sparta.

190
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,709
My guard will see you out.

191
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:22,475
It's funny that you mock freedom here in your ******

192
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:25,972
yet freedom inher wisdom.

193
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:28,361
has chosen you to defend her.

194
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,085
My Queen...

195
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,181
Will Sparta join our fight?

196
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:42,981
Apparantly Persian has offered Sparta
something they can not refuse.

197
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:44,485
And what?

198
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,148
A beautiful death.

199
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,397
They say you are the bravest among captains.

200
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:12,580
They say you're a whore
from the eastern seas.

201
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:19,112
not the smartest.

202
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:25,166
Your commander is a greek just like me.

203
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:29,931
<i>, you Persian men,
takes your orders from a  Greek woman.</i>

204
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:33,780
yes'my brother.i am greek by birth.

205
00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:37,040
And i have Greek blood running through my veins.

206
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:42,195
But my heart...

207
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:45,956
is Persian.

208
00:22:17,614 --> 00:22:19,300
Within hours....

209
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,384
Greek fleet will be shut.

210
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:25,120
What about master?and mush feared sparta?

211
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,488
There is nothing to fear.

212
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:32,095
Only King Leonidas and his personal guards of 300.

213
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:33,499
march to fight.

214
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:36,037
look...

215
00:22:39,472 --> 00:22:40,591
you...

216
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:48,544
Do you agree?

217
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:52,727
Many of will perish...

218
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:56,299
your Confidence leaves me with a strong impression.

219
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,888
It's a curious thing for a single ship guard,to not learn his eyes when question by me.

220
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:02,892
for the eyes, and when I asked him something.

221
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:07,097
******* lack of discipline.

222
00:23:08,408 --> 00:23:10,879
A man's hands do not lie.

223
00:23:10,914 --> 00:23:16,165
they can reveal every  imperfections and flaws of his character.

224
00:23:17,168 --> 00:23:21,544
You see, your hands are not rough enough to work
to***of the ship.

225
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:27,569
I know every single man beneath my lash.
you explain to me.

226
00:23:27,604 --> 00:23:29,379
how i know you?

227
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:33,690
Excuse me Commander.

228
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:38,974
let me introduce myself.

229
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,425
ceise the spy!

230
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,391
coward.

231
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:05,437
Storm is upon us.

232
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,860
It's just some bad greek whether.

233
00:24:23,684 --> 00:24:25,789
Themistocles
-come.

234
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:33,291
-
Calisto - we are spoken here would not be repeated.

235
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:35,266
Anywhere.

236
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:41,357
My son has not earn the right to sit at the table of combat of veterens,

237
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,160
but you can trust him.

238
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:44,818
very well.

239
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,384
- Tell me.
- A greek women commands all the xerxes ships to the south.

240
00:24:51,654 --> 00:24:55,146
Artemisia, I know of her.

241
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:59,123
Artemisia is merderous by trade which whose skills at sea.

242
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:02,103
she has thirst for vengeance.

243
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:06,374
her entire family was murdered by a scodd of greek ****.

244
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:09,719
I have heard all the stories.

245
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,219
The story goes that raped and murdered her family.

246
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:48,335
When they turned their attention towards her...

247
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,992
After years being kept above in greek slave ship.

248
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:18,650
she was discard and left for dead.

249
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,887
where she found near dead by percian himself.

250
00:26:41,427 --> 00:26:44,992
Artemisia  vowed  that day to return to greece.

251
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,252
only when she could watch it burn.

252
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,706
shewas fed,clothed and trained by the finest warriors

253
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:04,669
of Persian empire.

254
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:10,683
no match could be found for her skills and gift for the sword.

255
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,930
great King Darius was impressed by her commitment.

256
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:45,195
and she quickly grows
next commander.

257
00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:51,526
She has sold her soul to the death himself.

258
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:56,178
some could say i sold mine to greece.

259
00:27:59,837 --> 00:28:01,952
- What do you think?
- <i>?</i>

260
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,758
Guess, You are the future of this country.

261
00:28:05,614 --> 00:28:07,997
I am ready to fight.

262
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:14,125
I like him.

263
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,831
we will need every last man.
He's still just a boy.

264
00:28:16,832 --> 00:28:19,789
-a much younger had defended our country, father.
- Enough!

265
00:28:21,244 --> 00:28:24,541
You are a dreamer who
speak of this no more.

266
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,141
Themistocles,
I said your plan in motion

267
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,150
and my land force will be assemble by the secondary.

268
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,743
you won't be needed.

269
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:37,378
I can assure you of that.

270
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:44,686
now there is a bad news.
Leonidas has marched north to the hot gates.

271
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:49,281
Bad news?
The Spartans on the hot gates

272
00:28:49,384 --> 00:28:50,882
our victory is assured.

273
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:53,006
If the army will with him.

274
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:58,122
<i> Between Oracle and ,carny
Leonidas has marched with 300 men </i>

275
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:04,440
So the only thing standing between  Athens and total elimination
</i>

276
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:08,378
<i> is Leonidas and 300 Spartans </i>

277
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:17,961
establish a oder around the volunteers.

278
00:29:17,996 --> 00:29:22,104
Good.
Allow them time to teach them some of their strategies.

279
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:24,700
Just keep them well fed ...

280
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:27,654
and sober.

281
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:31,874
- Anything else?
- It would not hurt if they swim to shore.

282
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:36,419
I'll be damned!

283
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:40,988
- Damn!
- Does your father  know that  you're here?

284
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,497
No, sir.

285
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:46,024
- And a shield and sword?
- My grandfathers'.

286
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,883
My mother entrusted them to me morning.

287
00:29:49,735 --> 00:29:52,648
- she gave her blessing?
- Yes, sir.

288
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:55,932
it's a sharp blade...

289
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,447
Your father is preparing a surprise raide in tomorrow.

290
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:04,066
I choose to fight here, now.

291
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:09,481
Come aboad my ship and it is where you fight.

292
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:11,085
Yes, sir.

293
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:16,838
We just own a 50 ships.

294
00:30:16,873 --> 00:30:19,304
Persian Forces are devoted nonthethan thousands.

295
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:21,158
ships appear hardly see worthy.

296
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:23,261
nothing like the monstrous ships in the persian fleet.

297
00:30:23,296 --> 00:30:26,992
Then we have the advantage.
Speed and maneuverability.

298
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:32,463
Rest this city stakes in any of them handfull to a single ship,of cause happens.
supply the balance.

299
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:38,154
We have a report that a small  avance force of percian ships are taken refuge from a storm just across the straight.

300
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:41,194
With the breaks,we can hit them at dawn.

301
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,036
- Early Greek victory.
- The gods has given us an opertuanity.

302
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:48,739
to wound the pesian and extract them greek moral.

303
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:54,554
attempting distraction.
We'll stick to the battle plan.

304
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:57,916
Today at sundown we'll sail out to meet to the main pecian fleet.

305
00:30:57,951 --> 00:31:01,038
We'll attack them in the open water with no short to narrow the battle.

306
00:31:01,073 --> 00:31:03,095
Attack a force over a thosand ships

307
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:05,198
with armfull of force is suiside.

308
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:08,564
Such is my plan.

309
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,400
Look at their exuse for navy.

310
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:18,769
Their ships are little treats.

311
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:21,751
I need a second in command , Ephialtes.

312
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:25,568
And whoever proves their exelence,will own place beside me.

313
00:31:26,895 --> 00:31:31,337
General Bandari has offered to lead the first attack.

314
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:38,332
- Commander?
- I let you lead our first offense.

315
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:41,312
What guarantee do I have that you will bring me a quick victory
?

316
00:31:41,347 --> 00:31:44,481
-My word and my life.
- Good.

317
00:31:45,242 --> 00:31:50,985
- My rules of engagement?
- humiliate the Greeks and lay waste to their tiny ships.

318
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:54,566
They will be dead to the last man.

319
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:09,067
My brothers, steady your hearts,

320
00:32:11,235 --> 00:32:13,435
and look deep into your soul.

321
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:19,753
we will all be ***  tested this day.

322
00:32:24,073 --> 00:32:27,224
if we're in the heat of battle

323
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,965
You need a reason to fight on.

324
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:36,653
idea...which you will give up all that you'll ever have.

325
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:41,277
You need only to look at the man fights at your side.

326
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,254
This is the **** of battle.

327
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:48,413
This is the brotherhood of men and arms.

328
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:54,135
An unbreakable bond made stronger by the cruisifer of the combat.

329
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:59,703
You never will be close with all those who shared your blood with.

330
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:05,152
There is no nobler cause that the fight for those 

331
00:33:05,372 --> 00:33:07,155
who lay down and given their life for you.

332
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,834
You fight strong today.

333
00:33:12,926 --> 00:33:16,313
you fight for your brothers.

334
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:17,715
Fight for your families.

335
00:33:19,151 --> 00:33:22,021
Most of all you fught for greece.

336
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:30,139
THere is only one thing to make sure when the fighting starts.

337
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,282
What's that?

338
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:34,286
Do not get killed on the first day.

339
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,768
That goes for the rest of you.

340
00:34:09,945 --> 00:34:12,640
Persian ships are strong in the front.

341
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,473
but they are weak in the middle.
we attack them there.

342
00:34:27,384 --> 00:34:29,349
Now!

343
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,527
Round Up!

344
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,004
Reverse!
Now!

345
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:56,377
Go through them.

346
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:53,207
Enemy's tactics are created.

347
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:56,853
Defensife circle is no front on .....*

348
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:59,702
-we're loosing.
- No, you are loosing.

349
00:37:06,362 --> 00:37:10,228
Pull back.
Let them have this day.

350
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:13,513
I'm bored with your failures
Bandari.

351
00:37:18,646 --> 00:37:20,770
I will not let this wound slow me.

352
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:23,281
Somehow, I believe you.

353
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,972
My blade will be sharp and ready by the morning.

354
00:37:26,107 --> 00:37:29,257
Good.
Tomorrow you will fight along side with your father.

355
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:36,247
- Not bad for bunch of farmers.
- And poets and sculptors.

356
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:38,733
Who would've known group of untrained men do so well

357
00:37:38,736 --> 00:37:41,336
against such a considarable ****

358
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:46,847
WE are gonna need all of our stength tomorrow's fight.

359
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:49,329
How long do you think we can hold?

360
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:55,040
If my plan is to work...

361
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:59,743
Long enough for spatans to unite the greece.

362
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:05,340
Who shall share their wine with me?

363
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:21,370
- Report!
- we're still carrying the losses.

364
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,335
But you must understand that

365
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,295
it is extremly difficult

366
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:29,158
live in the sea and......

367
00:38:39,756 --> 00:38:41,056
Report?

368
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:44,865
75 ships lost.
30 ships need be repaired.

369
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,571
20 good return a few weeks work in a safe harbour.

370
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:54,779
the commander of the greek force named Teotocles.

371
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:56,782
Yes, He is an athenian genaral.

372
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:02,019
He is Rumored to lose the arrow that fell the great 
king Darius himself.

373
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:35,005
This Themistocles has shown himself quiet brilliant in battle.

374
00:39:37,428 --> 00:39:40,273
Which is more I can say for any of you.
.

375
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:44,077
Do you gentlemen find my command reasonable?

376
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:47,516
Is it too much to ask for victory?

377
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,965
Your dissapointment in yesterday's losses is warrented.

378
00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:54,334
My dissapointment?

379
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:58,755
My dissapointment is not with my losses.

380
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:03,623
A *** number of damaged ships and dead slavesmeans nothing to me. 
No.

381
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:07,057
My dissapontment...

382
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,391
Is in these men.

383
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:15,100
for stand among ten thousand.

384
00:40:15,568 --> 00:40:17,150
I am alone.

385
00:40:19,026 --> 00:40:23,006
I longed for a soul who stands by my side

386
00:40:23,032 --> 00:40:24,508
I can trust.

387
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:34,264
Tell me General Kashani,
Are you that man?

388
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:39,606
You will taste your victory by the day's end.

389
00:40:40,244 --> 00:40:44,037
I'll make certain of it.

390
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:45,979
I hope so.

391
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:19,631
Advance!

392
00:42:26,648 --> 00:42:30,609
Now!

393
00:42:54,084 --> 00:42:56,278
Got any sight of them?

394
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:14,404
- The Greeks are retreated.
- He's got it right where he want it.

395
00:43:14,439 --> 00:43:16,454
General Kashani is a fine stactition....

396
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,417
Speaking of Themistocles.

397
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:31,549
Rocks!

398
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,007
Stop!

399
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:40,288
Raise your self.

400
00:46:25,155 --> 00:46:28,590
- What are you doing here?
-A man's responsibility is 

401
00:46:28,766 --> 00:46:30,702
 protect his family and his nation.

402
00:46:30,769 --> 00:46:33,406
- Who told you this?
- My father.

403
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,417
you see how euphemistically is
frustration with the grandeur?

404
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:42,667
Why is it so much to ask a victory?

405
00:47:42,742 --> 00:47:44,671
- How can i make a...
- Silence.

406
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:50,659
you will carry a massage for me.

407
00:47:52,134 --> 00:47:56,473
Now they will fear us!
Now they will fear the Greeks!

408
00:47:56,812 --> 00:48:00,104
He's right!

409
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:05,135
 fear the Greek fighting men.
fear his sword and his shield.

410
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,488
Fear his love for mother greece.
,

411
00:48:08,821 --> 00:48:10,492
but most of all...

412
00:48:10,798 --> 00:48:12,370
 fear his freedom.

413
00:48:18,525 --> 00:48:20,302
Do not get angry with the boy.

414
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:24,960
- I took him under my command.
- Anger is somthing I reserved from  my enemies.

415
00:48:33,722 --> 00:48:35,444
Themistocles!

416
00:48:55,531 --> 00:48:59,171
Artemisia ship is being anchored to neutral waters.

417
00:48:59,449 --> 00:49:03,365
- she's like to  meet with Themistocles.
- How can you gurantee his safe return?

418
00:49:03,772 --> 00:49:05,111
Well,boy/

419
00:49:05,146 --> 00:49:09,322
THe only honor for her now will be watching you crush

420
00:49:09,357 --> 00:49:13,064
and broken fleet sink in to the bottom Aegean.

421
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:15,057
She will be able to recognize you

422
00:49:15,092 --> 00:49:17,763
nailed to the master ship with her sword.

423
00:49:18,097 --> 00:49:20,768
as you descent in to the waterly grave.

424
00:49:26,287 --> 00:49:28,754
Why didn't you say that in begining?


425
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,880
Welcome to my ***** ship.

426
00:49:58,915 --> 00:50:01,183
We are honored by your presence.

427
00:50:04,227 --> 00:50:08,653
******** you.quiet impressive.

428
00:50:13,229 --> 00:50:15,279
Kind ones...


429
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,780
Now come Themistocles,
We must
 discuss.

430
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,378
Do you believe the Greeks are descendants from the gods?

431
00:50:24,413 --> 00:50:27,724
I have heard something.

432
00:50:27,994 --> 00:50:29,865
And what of you?still a god in new**

433
00:50:34,045 --> 00:50:36,901
I say there's a spoken the
 divine in you.

434
00:50:38,588 --> 00:50:41,094
Now who's using kind words.

435
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:52,357

My men used to say it was you slaged the good king Darius at Marothon.  

436
00:50:53,272 --> 00:50:55,591
Many heroic deeds occured that day.

437
00:50:55,626 --> 00:50:57,853
It was 10 years ago.

438
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,742
Facts of  battle are
 often reimeged.

439
00:50:59,892 --> 00:51:02,347
This deed you would remember.


440
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:06,907
I will do what i must to defend greece.


441
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:10,084
And I'll do what I must to defeat her.

442
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:16,165
For every greek get killed you must kill a thousand percians.
.

443
00:51:17,739 --> 00:51:19,898
For every ship I sink

444
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:21,922
you must sink a hundred.

445
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:25,127
Against **** weeks,months 

446
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:27,689
If maybe.

447
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:33,337
My numbers will defeat you.
And I'll take your precious boats with my sword and i'll take your greek freedom.


448
00:51:34,912 --> 00:51:37,995
you asking me to ne
gotiate a surrender?

449
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:39,995
No. ..

450
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:43,200
I offer you a chance to avoid such a misery and join me.

451
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:47,181
I may have a need of a commander such
 as you.

452
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:50,596
Look at the
 defense.

453
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:56,467
A handfull of****

Leonidas and with Spartans.

454
00:51:58,259 --> 00:52:02,914
It is insulting to the mightiest empire  the world has ever seen.

455
00:52:05,129 --> 00:52:07,460
I didn't blam you
, Themistocles.

456
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:12,894
You fought as if the blood of posiden himself causing through your veins.


457
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:15,203
I blame Greece.


458
00:52:16,311 --> 00:52:19,161
Bureaucracy and political protecting *******

459
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:21,797
 and sending you here to die.

460
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:28,395
And yet he still fights.


461
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:34,075
So there must be.....what?


462
00:52:35,539 --> 00:52:39,705
A family back who holds nothing but compells you to..


463
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,300
fight with such a passion..


464
00:52:45,612 --> 00:52:47,975
Actually I had no time for family.

465
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:52,963
I've spent my entire life with my one true love
.

466
00:52:54,133 --> 00:52:58,073
the Greek Fleet...an amount  passion

467
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,372
readying it 
for you.

468
00:53:04,313 --> 00:53:09,379
Now that it brings me pleasure the s ought of you hiving away from me


469
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:13,221
seeking family and love


470
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,951
A promise that deeper ****

471
00:53:23,656 --> 00:53:26,999
The Ecstasy of you in flesh


472
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:31,395
Death and knives...

473
00:53:32,906 --> 00:53:37,562
and rage....and sweat of mucsle.


474
00:53:38,806 --> 00:53:40,799
of 
pure joy

475
00:53:41,825 --> 00:53:44,676

And deepest sorrow.

476
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,771
Dine with me tonight and be born with me in morning..


477
00:53:49,842 --> 00:53:53,132
 sword into the hearts of our enemy

478
00:53:57,244 --> 00:53:59,146

479
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:02,951
 I offer freedom
 without consequences or responsibilities

480
00:54:06,361 --> 00:54:08,334

Be quick with your sword.

00:56:48,683 --> 00:56:52,109
You'll not have your death tonight.
Guards!

Remove this filth from my ship.


489
00:57:22,846 --> 00:57:26,063
Well, what have you learned?

490
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:36,443
Can Artemisia be beat?


491
00:57:37,312 --> 00:57:41,664
The next time  that we face her.she's going to bring war of hell wiyh her.



492
00:58:50,316 --> 00:58:52,733

- Pull back

- Retreat!

494
00:59:22,036 --> 00:59:25,566
Retreat!

495
00:59:25,601 --> 00:59:28,427
Themistocles, in the water!

496
00:59:32,049 --> 00:59:34,522
Archers.ark that now.


497
00:59:34,557 --> 00:59:36,565
Archers 
on the deck now!

498
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,374
Fast!

499
00:59:38,404 --> 00:59:40,075
Fire......

500
01:00:56,102 --> 01:01:00,117
fight on, boy!
fight on.


501
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:23,859
Aim for the man on top.
aim for him.

502
01:02:33,972 --> 01:02:37,178
Abandon ship!

503
01:04:24,552 --> 01:04:29,261
The dead have no guilt.
No responsibility </i>

504
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:35,872
<i> Themistocles watched bodies of his men turned The Aegean red with blood. 
</i>

505
01:04:37,275 --> 01:04:39,581
Were they sacrificed with his ego?


506
01:04:40,783 --> 01:04:44,288
Or to e*** the guilt of long ago mistake at Marathon.


507
01:04:47,795 --> 01:04:52,503
How many men would have been 
saved  if Themistocles had kiledl that boy.


508
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:57,913
Not even his own soul can be sure.


509
01:04:59,918 --> 01:05:03,925
And you my friend,we fight 
*****

510
01:05:05,326 --> 01:05:06,728
together.


511
01:05:09,134 --> 01:05:12,038
Listen to me, Themistocles,


512
01:05:15,846 --> 01:05:20,954
You'll have to fight twice as much as strength in the morning.


513
01:05:21,957 --> 01:05:25,762
- we'll fight shoulder to shoulder.
- No, my son.


514
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,770
You carry on for both of us.


515
01:06:29,168 --> 01:06:30,369
What did he say?

516
01:06:33,176 --> 01:06:35,179
I will tell you in time, boy.



517
01:06:37,384 --> 01:06:38,585
Quiet now.

518
01:06:40,088 --> 01:06:42,192
God be with your father's spirit.


519
01:06:50,805 --> 01:06:53,811
How many times do you think we'll repeat such a tragedy?


520
01:06:56,015 --> 01:06:57,819
As many as times we must.


521
01:06:58,422 --> 01:07:00,525
We are turning young men in to memories.


522
01:07:03,429 --> 01:07:05,233
Do you think I enjoy this?


523
01:07:07,037 --> 01:07:09,541
Witnessing my friend's last breath.


524
01:07:13,047 --> 01:07:15,752
Every widow that has made by my dicision.


525
01:07:17,557 --> 01:07:19,860
every child who'll  grow up without a father
.

526
01:07:22,065 --> 01:07:28,075
They are my choices.
This is the burden of my command.


527
01:07:52,415 --> 01:07:57,022
How easy is it to silence strong and self destruct.


528
01:07:57,925 --> 01:08:01,430
Let my army witness the great warriors of sparta.

.

529
01:08:04,136 --> 01:08:06,440
March them past these corpses.


530
01:08:06,841 --> 01:08:10,548
Let them see
cost dared to challenge the god-king.

531
01:08:14,656 --> 01:08:17,234
King Leonidas and his brave 300

532
01:08:17,235 --> 01:08:20,464
The finest Greece has to offer.


533
01:08:20,765 --> 01:08:24,272
There will be no saviors to rise up and f***** us.


534
01:08:25,273 --> 01:08:28,179
Nothing will stop the march of my empire.

535
01:08:32,889 --> 01:08:34,191
your majesty...


536
01:08:34,391 --> 01:08:37,795
You take the this dead king's sword to Athens.


537
01:08:38,098 --> 01:08:41,303
Let them know that I am coming next for them.


538
01:08:42,306 --> 01:08:49,016
Let them know.....Athens, their jewel of the city.


539
01:08:50,019 --> 01:08:52,323
Will disappear from the history.


540
01:08:56,231 --> 01:08:57,132
Themistocles!

541
01:09:00,938 --> 01:09:02,442
I bring word from
 Thermopylae.

542
01:09:02,443 --> 01:09:06,348
Leonidas was betrayed by a honk back.
Spartans has been slaughtered.

543
01:09:06,551 --> 01:09:07,953
Hotgates are falling 
.

544
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:12,561
Such a sacrifice 
!

545
01:09:16,968 --> 01:09:18,772
Now Greece has
 a martyr.

546
01:09:20,275 --> 01:09:24,182
Daxos, take this message from the hotgates.


547
01:09:24,483 --> 01:09:28,892
to every city,to village and to every country men.


548
01:09:28,893 --> 01:09:32,097
- hear your words.
- but they are dead,all of them.


549
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:34,701
Sparta's sacrifice is what's
 unite us.

550
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:36,606
Now, go!

551
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,815
move all of  our shipa and men back to the safty and.....

552
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:45,823
- And you? I will take  Daxos's massage to  Athens.

553
01:09:47,526 --> 01:09:50,933
i was told honkback
Fire Doors Atul hair bump.

554
01:09:52,136 --> 01:09:53,937
but he sold out his
 country.

555
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:59,649
from his back and replace it with persian gold. 

556
01:10:01,452 --> 01:10:04,357
What is your name, traitor?

557
01:10:04,358 --> 01:10:07,163
Ephialtes of
 Thrace.

558
01:10:19,785 --> 01:10:23,389
I shall wet this noble blade with your blood.



559
01:10:25,094 --> 01:10:27,197

 you would be right to do so.

560
01:10:27,698 --> 01:10:30,603
 there is little beauty about me .


561
01:10:30,904 --> 01:10:34,411
and there is a little beauty in what i have done.


562
01:10:39,621 --> 01:10:41,223
Say what you must.


563
01:10:41,826 --> 01:10:43,294
I beg of you.

564
01:10:44,197 --> 01:10:46,085
and all the Athenians.

565
01:10:46,086 --> 01:10:50,038
The God King will burn this city to the ground.

566
01:10:51,342 --> 01:10:53,044
quiet yourself.


567
01:10:53,245 --> 01:10:56,450
 Leonidas and the Spartans' great sacrifice.


568
01:10:56,653 --> 01:10:58,155
was no defeat.

569
01:11:01,161 --> 01:11:02,862
It was a beautiful victory,


570
01:11:04,867 --> 01:11:08,374
This simple act of ****


571
01:11:09,175 --> 01:11:11,980
Will allow us to rally each of our city states


572
01:11:11,981 --> 01:11:15,987
and unite Greece.For one purpose.


573
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:18,692
against one enemy.


574
01:11:19,694 --> 01:11:23,801
And you,you take this message to your God King,


575
01:11:23,802 --> 01:11:26,463
We will take whatever ships we have left


576
01:11:27,365 --> 01:11:30,113
And finish this in
 bay of Salamis.

577
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:35,123
- But there will be death and destruction?
- Yes


578
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,027
There will be.


579
01:11:44,138 --> 01:11:45,721
Themistocles.

580
01:11:48,025 --> 01:11:49,849
I'm here to speak to the queen.


581
01:11:50,952 --> 01:11:54,859
I warn you, Athenian,
you may not recieve a worm wecome.


582
01:12:22,302 --> 01:12:24,505
May I offer my deepest sympathies.


583
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:29,315
We can not change what has happened to Leonidas.

584
01:12:29,816 --> 01:12:32,020
But his sacrifice will not be forgotten.

585
01:12:33,324 --> 01:12:37,431
Do not lecture me of sacrifice and
be quick with your words,Athenian.


586
01:12:39,836 --> 01:12:42,641
I request of you the entire spartan navy.



587
01:12:43,944 --> 01:12:46,347
Every man,every ship that you can spare.


588
01:12:46,348 --> 01:12:49,153
Have i not given enough for your dream of united Greece.


589
01:12:50,156 --> 01:12:54,061
Shall i put sword in hands of my son.
Our children?

590
01:12:54,062 --> 01:12:55,064
Would that please you?


591
01:12:56,369 --> 01:12:59,874
have I not given enough for your ambitions,
Themistocles?


592
01:13:00,475 --> 01:13:06,986
A King, husbands, fathers, brothers.
Sparta will give no more.


593
01:13:23,313 --> 01:13:25,017
This belongs with you.


594
01:13:35,033 --> 01:13:36,335
Avenge him!

595
01:13:54,566 --> 01:13:59,875
Oracle's words stood as a warning.
 All of Greece will fall.

596
01:14:00,676 --> 01:14:03,781
AS persian fire reduces The Athenes to thinder.

597
01:14:05,486 --> 01:14:10,193
For Athenes ith's a pile of stone and wood and cloth and dust.

598
01:14:11,295 --> 01:14:14,001
As dust would vanish into the wind.

599
01:14:15,905 --> 01:14:19,710
Only the Athenian themselves exist.

600
01:14:20,012 --> 01:14:23,117
And the fathe of the world hangs on their every syllable.


601
01:14:24,118 --> 01:14:26,623
Only the Athenians exist.


602
01:14:26,923 --> 01:14:29,829
and only ***

wooden ships can save them.

603
01:14:30,831 --> 01:14:32,133
Wooden Ships...

604
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:35,739
And the tidal waves of heroes'
 blood.

605
01:14:43,254 --> 01:14:45,958
The Greeks would be fools to stand against us.


606
01:14:46,461 --> 01:14:50,767
Leonidas and Sparta is no match for the will of the God's.


607
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:57,078
Themistocles  is worth it.


608
01:14:57,479 --> 01:15:03,489
 Worthless coward,Now, this pathetic navy *******

609
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:08,497
that wothless coward has stood up my side wounded up the world at you feet.


610
01:15:09,702 --> 01:15:13,707
My king...your Humble servent.


611
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:19,518
brings you news.
The Greek fleets are defendless.




612
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:24,928
In bay of salamis,
you need only to finish them.


613
01:15:25,429 --> 01:15:27,533
Who cammands their forces?


614
01:15:30,839 --> 01:15:34,044
Themistocles of Athens.

615
01:15:34,045 --> 01:15:35,349
Themistocles is dead.


616
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:38,955
He's alive.
I have seen him myself..


617
01:15:52,877 --> 01:15:57,284
Ready my troops and ***.
We'll attack at once.


618
01:15:57,487 --> 01:15:58,287
Where is them?


619
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:03,697
would have a send a probin force to  confirm it is not a trap.

620
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:07,505
you'd dare advise me on *** of war?


621
01:16:08,907 --> 01:16:13,916
I am the God-king.
I am the one who ***** over Leonidas.



622
01:16:14,017 --> 01:16:17,924
I am the one who laid waste of shore piece of athens.


623
01:16:17,925 --> 01:16:20,029
I am your king.

624
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:23,835
killing Leonidas and his men only made them
martyrs.

625
01:16:24,837 --> 01:16:26,399
But when you erased Athens,


626
01:16:27,302 --> 01:16:31,350
you set fire to the only thing that value in this country.


627
01:16:42,969 --> 01:16:48,778
We will attack the greeks with my entire navy.


628
01:16:50,482 --> 01:16:52,786
Artemisia, enough!

629
01:16:54,388 --> 01:16:59,899
Do not forget who put the crown on your childish head, My King.


630
01:17:01,401 --> 01:17:02,986
Now sit on your golden throne,


631
01:17:02,987 --> 01:17:05,908
watch this battle from the safety I provide you.

632
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:17,728
 We're in the distance,
we'd miss the destruction of Athens.

633
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:24,942
Along real face of the monster that cast a shadow across our land.


634
01:17:28,247 --> 01:17:29,925
I had prayed that the Spartans would come to

635
01:17:29,926 --> 01:17:31,854
 led a hand in this morning.



636
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,164
perhaps they feel they've given enough.


637
01:17:37,165 --> 01:17:38,766
You've failed us all.


638
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:40,271
This is your fault, Themistocles.

639
01:17:40,272 --> 01:17:42,173
without  Spartan we are just farmhands.


640
01:17:42,174 --> 01:17:44,880
we should've 
negotiated with the Persians whenhe had the chance.


641
01:17:49,488 --> 01:17:50,589
you are all right.


642
01:17:52,796 --> 01:17:56,301
Yes, we are down to a handful of boats.


643
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,001
and yes we are just farmhands.

644
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,400
we are tradesmen.
we are boys.


645
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
turned to men through the sacrifice.

646
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,200
forge of combat.


647
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:16,400
I played a dangerous game
and i lost.

648
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
if you choose to turn your back on me.
on your country.

649
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,200
I will not judge you.
you are free to leave.

650
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,400
your still free men.

651
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,600
very well.

652
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,585
Then let us put our shoulder to work.

653
01:19:07,586 --> 01:19:10,332
and free those ships from the busam of greece.


654
01:19:12,133 --> 01:19:14,939
Today is a privilege to call our own

655
01:19:16,643 --> 01:19:20,452
A story that would be told for a thousand yeas.


656
01:19:21,355 --> 01:19:25,557
let our final stand be recorded to the history.

657
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:31,267
let it be shown that we chose to die on our feet.

658
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:33,873
rather than live on your knees.

659
01:20:21,951 --> 01:20:24,255
There is only one thing you need to know today.

660
01:20:24,558 --> 01:20:25,959
not to get killed


661
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,764
No.

662
01:20:28,165 --> 01:20:30,068
 your father's Last words.

663
01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:36,980
He told me  you have to earn the right to sit at the table.

664
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:58,616
Well my brother, no more tactics and tricks
.

665
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:02,924
This will be the last battle that we share.

666
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,760
we were full next to one another for as long as I can remember.
 

667
01:21:07,735 --> 01:21:10,738
nothing will please me more than the rest this sword.

668
01:21:12,243 --> 01:21:16,450
- The preparation that i require...
- are below deck.

669
01:21:16,851 --> 01:21:17,853
Good.

670
01:21:18,353 --> 01:21:20,759
ARe you sure you want to commit everything?
-yes



671
01:21:24,366 --> 01:21:27,873
Without Aretemisia's command pesian navy will be nothing.


672
01:21:28,776 --> 01:21:32,581
- We will never be able to reach her.
- I'll reach her.


673
01:21:33,784 --> 01:21:35,587
And put an end to this.

674
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:38,793
There will be no room for a retreat.


675
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,298
I know.

676
01:21:44,204 --> 01:21:47,209
Today the last GReek ships will be destroyed.


677
01:21:48,012 --> 01:21:52,618
show them no mercy!
Give them no quarter
!

678
01:21:53,019 --> 01:21:56,626
Today we will dance above the backs of dead greeks.


679
01:21:56,727 --> 01:21:59,530
Today we deliver submission.


680
01:22:00,233 --> 01:22:04,440
Today, I wanna feel Themistocles troat beneath my boots.
 

681
01:22:35,593 --> 01:22:38,297
Men! brace  yourselves.

682
01:23:32,286 --> 01:23:35,791
ATTACK....

683
01:23:45,809 --> 01:23:47,813
feel your glory!


684
01:24:16,161 --> 01:24:18,764
I'm not here as a witness,


685
01:25:20,565 --> 01:25:21,667
Now!

686
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:25,374
Let them send their souls straight to hell.


687
01:27:11,749 --> 01:27:14,752
We all **** our consequences and responsibilities.


688
01:27:14,753 --> 01:27:16,756
Are you accepting my offer?


689
01:27:16,757 --> 01:27:18,561
My answer is still no.

690
01:27:46,407 --> 01:27:49,112
You fight much harder than you fuck.
\

691
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:35,589
Surrender to me or meet your death.


692
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:37,492
Who do you fight, if not for me?

693
01:28:38,696 --> 01:28:40,797
No one could chalenge your skill.


694
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:43,903
I would rather die free man than as a slave.



695
01:28:45,108 --> 01:28:47,611
Even was the chains attached to you.


696
01:28:56,727 --> 01:29:01,734
It begins as a whisper,a promise.


697
01:29:10,349 --> 01:29:13,655
It moves through her hair as gently as a lover's hand.


698
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:18,864
That breeze that promise became a wind.


699
01:29:19,267 --> 01:29:23,374
A wind was blown across Greece carrying a massage told again and again


700
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:24,877
of our lady freedom.

701
01:29:26,978 --> 01:29:29,787
How wise she was to charge Leonidas
to lay all at her feet.


702
01:29:31,791 --> 01:29:34,395
A wind that my brothers have
 sacrificed
.

703
01:29:36,499 --> 01:29:38,203
A wind of freedom.

704
01:29:40,707 --> 01:29:42,711
A wind of justise.


705
01:29:50,523 --> 01:29:52,526
A wind of vengeance.


706
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:41,406
You're being surrounded.All of Greece has united against you.


707
01:30:42,509 --> 01:30:48,419
Delphi, Thebes, Olympus,
Arcadia and Sparta.

708
01:31:02,645 --> 01:31:05,348
If death comes for me today,I am ready.


709
01:31:06,451 --> 01:31:08,455
I could lower my sword.


710
01:31:09,057 --> 01:31:11,861
There is still time for you to ready a launch and escape.


711
01:31:15,669 --> 01:31:19,674
It would be a poor choice,to force my hand into action.


712
01:31:19,977 --> 01:31:23,482
Now all your ships disengage and surronded to me.


713
01:31:26,088 --> 01:31:27,390
surronder?


714
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:35,090
