1
00:00:52,487 --> 00:01:02,487


2
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:57,937
- Nhà không có ai à? - Có bà nội đấy. Cô ấy bị lãng tai.

3
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:01,319
Đừng! Đó là phòng của cô ấy. Cái này của tôi ư!

4
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,770
- Chúc ngủ ngon! - Im đi!

5
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:06,270
Tôi sẽ trở lại ngay.

6
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:14,062
Chetan Bhagat!

7
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,611
<i>Lợi ích của việc trở thành hoa tường vi!</i> Bạn đã đọc nó chưa?

8
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:23,152
Tôi đọc sách. Đã xem phim. Và tôi là một!

9
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:26,937
Bạn là gì? Một bông hoa tường vi hay một đặc quyền?

10
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,694
Bạn là hoa tường vi phải không?

11
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:34,152
Bạn tìm cho mình một góc. Nghe và nhìn thấy mọi thứ

12
00:04:34,153 --> 00:04:37,145
nhưng không bao giờ làm bất cứ điều gì. Tôi cần làm vài thứ.

13
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,520
Bạn đọc <i>Sophie Kinsella</i>?

14
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:43,027
Tôi đã cố gắng nhưng không thể hoàn thành.

15
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:44,152
Tại sao?

16
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:49,111
Khó quá Natasha bảo tôi đọc nó.

17
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:51,736
Bạn hiểu Wallflower chứ không phải Kinsella?

18
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:53,187
Đó là một điều dễ đọc.

19
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,770
Hoa tường vi hay ruồi đều như nhau.

20
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:01,062
Bạn thật thông minh!

21
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:34,603
Chuyện gì vậy? đây là lần đầu tiên của bạn?

22
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:38,812
- Thật sự? - Đúng.

23
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:41,395
Hãy để tôi dạy bạn.

24
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:57,145
Trà?

25
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:11,853
Chuyện gì đã xảy ra tối qua...

26
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,777
đã tốt, phải không?

27
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:16,270
- Đúng. - Đúng.

28
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,103
Đó là điều tự nhiên, phải không?

29
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:24,937
Đừng phá hỏng nó bằng cách nói về nó.

30
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,978
Đừng nói về nó.

31
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:31,312
Tôi không nên có.

32
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,111
- Cậu sẽ không yêu phải không? - KHÔNG.

33
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:40,353
Đừng suy nghĩ quá nhiều về nó.

34
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:43,437
- Được rồi. - Được chứ?

35
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:55,444
Mihir đã nói với tôi rằng các bạn

36
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:57,402
có xu hướng dễ xúc động sau khi quan hệ tình dục

37
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:59,812
và họ yêu nhau.

38
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:09,520
Họ trở nên sở hữu.

39
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:17,187
Chắc chắn.

40
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,645
Nó là gì? Tại sao bạn cười?

41
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,353
Chúng ta có chia sẻ bí mật không?

42
00:07:57,653 --> 00:07:58,853
Chúng tôi có làm vậy không?

43
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:02,187
Tôi đã 26 tuổi

44
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,520
khi tôi kết hôn với Mihir.

45
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:06,770
Anh hơn tôi 12 tuổi.

46
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:11,069
Tôi chưa bao giờ hẹn hò với ai cả.

47
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,187
Nhưng Mihir đã hẹn hò với nhiều cô gái.

48
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:21,819
Vì vậy, kết hôn với một người đàn ông lớn tuổi hơn tôi nhiều tuổi là một cuộc phiêu lưu đối với tôi.

49
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,111
Bố mẹ tôi đã phản đối điều đó.

50
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:27,819
Anh ấy có rất nhiều câu chuyện để chia sẻ! Giống như anh ấy đã đi đâu đó,

51
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,027
gặp một cô gái ở đó và họ bắt đầu nói chuyện.

52
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:36,895
Những câu chuyện của anh ấy giống như bước ra từ một bộ phim.

53
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:39,777
Tôi không có bất kỳ thứ gì trong số đó.

54
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:44,270
Chúng tôi đã nói chuyện và anh ấy đã làm cho tôi hiểu

55
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:48,319
rằng tôi sẽ bực bội với anh ấy

56
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,986
nếu tôi không sống theo ý mình.

57
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:55,145
Ông thúc giục tôi xem xét lại cuộc đời mình.

58
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:01,520
Cô có một người yêu, Imroze, trẻ hơn cô.

59
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,444
Draupadi sống với năm Pandavas.

60
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:11,694
Cô yêu họ và có lẽ họ cũng yêu cô.

61
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:13,895
Họ không tranh giành cô ấy.

62
00:09:18,362 --> 00:09:21,236
Tôi đã kết hôn và tôi không thể ở bên ai khác.

63
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:23,645
Nếu tôi tưởng tượng về ai đó thì sao?

64
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:24,611
Nó không ổn.

65
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:27,569
Làm thế nào bạn có thể mong đợi nhiều như vậy từ một người?

66
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:33,187
Bạn muốn anh ấy là người bạn tốt nhất, người yêu và trí tưởng tượng điên rồ nhất của bạn.

67
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:43,395
Tôi làm gì?

68
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:52,861
Thật tốt là cuối cùng họ cũng lên tiếng.

69
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:54,527
Nhưng làm thế nào họ có thể chứng minh điều đó?

70
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:57,111
Mọi người chơi bài nạn nhân để công khai.

71
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:58,520
Bạn đã đọc cái này chưa?

72
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:05,486
Người chồng đã ly dị cô ngay khi biết chuyện.

73
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:08,486
Những chuyện như thế thường xuyên xảy ra ở đó.

74
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:11,861
Nhưng nó sai rồi. Nó không ổn.

75
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,853
Tuổi của học sinh là bao nhiêu?

76
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,944
- Anh ấy 18 tuổi. - Vậy là anh ấy đã trưởng thành rồi.

77
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:22,228
- Điều đó có biện minh được không? - Dù anh ấy bao nhiêu tuổi...

78
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:29,569
- Nhưng anh ấy đã trưởng thành rồi! - Sao cậu biết đó là sự đồng ý?

79
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,520
Sự im lặng của anh ấy có nghĩa là đó không phải là sự đồng thuận.

80
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,861
- Tejas Bhave? - Đúng.

81
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:40,228
Tôi cần nói chuyện với bạn.

82
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,020
Bạn không nghĩ cô ấy kì lạ sao?

83
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:54,402
Nghe! Bạn bao nhiêu tuổi?

84
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,527
Tại sao?

85
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:57,486
- Hãy cho tôi biết tuổi của bạn! - 21.

86
00:10:57,487 --> 00:10:58,986
- Chắc chắn? - Đúng.

87
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:01,319
Đơn nhập học của bạn có nói như vậy không?

88
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,603
- Không. - Người ta thường làm vậy.

89
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,027
- Tôi không chắc. - Cố lên!

90
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:09,736
- Cậu có giấy khai sinh không? - Đúng.

91
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:10,944
Lấy nó cho tôi.

92
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:13,652
Lấy nó từ văn phòng trường đại học.

93
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:17,895
How can I go and ask for it? What if they ask me why?

94
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:21,228
Why do you need it?

95
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:23,603
Listen.

96
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:25,395
What happened that night

97
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:28,111
was consensual, right?

98
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:29,353
What do you mean?

99
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,103
Did I force you to have sex?

100
00:11:32,403 --> 00:11:33,562
No. But...

101
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:35,777
What?

102
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,562
You made the first move!

103
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:41,145
Did you say no?

104
00:11:41,153 --> 00:11:42,527
- No. - Exactly.

105
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:45,853
So, it was consensual, right?

106
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:49,611
Say it. Say that it was consensual.

107
00:11:49,612 --> 00:11:50,736
What do I say?

108
00:11:50,737 --> 00:11:52,986
Say that it was consensual.

109
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,152
- What is that word? - Consensual!

110
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:56,486
Yes. Say it.

111
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:57,687
It was.

112
00:11:57,862 --> 00:12:01,062
"Whatever happened between us was consensual."

113
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,062
- Whatever happened between us... - Yes...

114
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:06,319
- Was consensual! - Was consensual.

115
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,111
- Say it in one go. - The complete statement?

116
00:12:09,112 --> 00:12:10,069
- Yes. - Whatever...

117
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,902
Say this. "Whatever happened between us,"

118
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:14,853
"Ms. Kalindi, was consensual."

119
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:17,611
- Whatever... - "This is Tejas. Ms. Kalindi..."

120
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,978
"Whatever happened between us was consensual."

121
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:23,978
Ms. Kalindi, this is Tejas. Whatever happened between us...

122
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,527
- Was all... - That was all consensual!

123
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:29,103
Now say it properly!

124
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:32,728
Ms. Kalindi, whatever happened between us was consensual.

125
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:35,020
- I am Tejas. - Okay.

126
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,270
It's my fault! They have to hit me if I go home late.

127
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,294
<b>WwW.ZoCine.CoM Watch Movies And Series!</b>

128
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:55,944
Just go home. Shut the door. Play some nice music.

129
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:57,770
Wash your hands

130
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,728
Think of Hrithik Roshan and have a good time.

131
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:11,312
Now look at that girl. I said masturbation and she hid her face!

132
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:15,645
- Ms. Kalindi! - I came by to apologize.

133
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:16,944
Why?

134
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:20,194
I recorded your statement and scared you.

135
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:24,812
No. I did not understand anything. What was that word?

136
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:26,270
Forget it.

137
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:30,020
- Listen, now we're friends, okay? - Yes.

138
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:34,937
As in real friends... who share everything.

139
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,645
Okay.

140
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:39,562
- But without benefits. - What do you mean?

141
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,645
I mean I have a boyfriend now.

142
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:49,478
- Professor Neeraj! - Yes.

143
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,770
- The Mathematics professor? - Yes.

144
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:55,770
- Have you seen his hair? - Cool, right?

145
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:58,645
He isn't like the other guys.

146
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,694
He is faithful. Do you know what he says?

147
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:04,270
Did you know that

148
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:07,228
penguins are monogamous

149
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:12,603
and that helps them survive in the extreme cold?

150
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,853
He wants me to be only his.

151
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,145
And he doesn't find me weird. Unlike what your Natasha feels.

152
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:31,853
- My Natasha? - Yes!

153
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:33,895
I know everything.

154
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,069
I love Mihir

155
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,187
and I love Tejas too.

156
00:14:56,362 --> 00:15:00,020
If I love Tejas and Neeraj as well...

157
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,020
I will not hold myself back.

158
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:24,353
Where are you?

159
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,562
Where are you?

160
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:28,520
Where the hell are you?

161
00:15:32,153 --> 00:15:33,603
What happened?

162
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:38,478
- What happened? - You tell me!

163
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:40,770
You said it was urgent.

164
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,145
I took care of it.

165
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:46,277
- So easily? - It's not working out with Neeraj.

166
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,812
What happened?

167
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:52,687
I thought he was smart! Intelligent!

168
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:55,270
That he knows everything.

169
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:01,187
But not chemistry.

170
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:05,812
He doesn't know how to make a move.

171
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:11,937
It took him 17 days, 16 hours and 32 minutes to say...

172
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,562
I asked him the same question.

173
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:04,152
Wait!

174
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:07,270
- Do you have a condom? - In the drawer next to you.

175
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,895
- Should I wear it? - No.

176
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:17,853
- What happened? - Nothing!

177
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:19,228
What happened?

178
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:32,562
Found it!

179
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:40,145
- Answer it. - It's alright.

180
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:43,020
- Who called? - I don't know.

181
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,395
- Was it Natasha? - No.

182
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:56,103
So are you guys together?

183
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,145
It's over.

184
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,562
Really?

185
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:07,978
Did you have sex with her yet?

186
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:10,353
No.

187
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,353
Liar.

188
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:15,478
Why do you care?

189
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,478
- Don't I share my stories with you? - Do I ask you to?

190
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:22,478
You just vomit it all out.

191
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,687
What's happening between you and Natasha?

192
00:18:26,862 --> 00:18:28,145
Nothing.

193
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:31,611
Now that you and Professor Neeraj have broken up,

194
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,395
should we...

195
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:38,353
No?

196
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,937
Did you come here to text?

197
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,145
Give me your phone.

198
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:12,312
Passcode, please.

199
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:15,187
I have forgotten it.

200
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:18,395
Type the passcode.

201
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:24,312
See. I don't remember it.

202
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:31,770
Collect it from the office.

203
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,062
I am leaving.

204
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:43,103
Are you guys studying?

205
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:49,603
You sit with Rahul in the classroom,

206
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,527
with Akash in the cafeteria.

207
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:54,562
And now, you are with Tejas.

208
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,562
Your parents live in Dubai...

209
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,312
but they send you money, right?

210
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:06,270
Do you live alone?

211
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:40,020
Why did you do that?

212
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:44,353
Is she your girlfriend?

213
00:22:45,153 --> 00:22:46,478
No.

214
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,353
Mihir, can you hear me?

215
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:03,520
No one is ever honest with anyone.

216
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:06,277
Even my parents were not honest with each other!

217
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:09,527
No one is!

218
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:13,395
Although Mihir was with me, I was feeling guilty.

219
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:19,937
Why do I feel guilty?

220
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:22,103
What makes me feel that way?

221
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:27,062
You must love selflessly.

222
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,228
Mihir loves me like that.

223
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,770
Nothing!

224
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:40,728
Where are you?

225
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:52,062
- No! - I know you are dating Natasha.

226
00:24:52,612 --> 00:24:53,853
Where are you?

227
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:57,562
Tell me.

228
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,270
You are, aren't you?

229
00:25:01,945 --> 00:25:04,687
Tell me!

230
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:08,145
- Go to sleep. Good night. - Tell me...

231
00:25:32,737 --> 00:25:33,978
Mihir and I...

232
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:42,020
He calls me up and tells me everything.

233
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,444
I'm going to tell the truth too.

234
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:48,187
Something happened between Tejas and me.

235
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:50,027
We had something special.

236
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:52,020
So we owe this to each other.

237
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:54,978
I told him

238
00:25:55,112 --> 00:25:57,228
about my affair with Neeraj.

239
00:25:57,487 --> 00:26:01,645
I told him everything.

240
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,395
I told him when I got fed up.

241
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:41,228
I cannot be Mihir.

242
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:15,978
But Tejas lied to me when I asked him about them.

243
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:17,687
He lied to me.

244
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,103
I don't like being lied to.

245
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,937
He shouldn't have lied.

246
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,187
Tejas!

247
00:28:21,362 --> 00:28:23,062
Tejas?

248
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:24,645
He's inside.

249
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:30,728
Tejas!

250
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:35,562
Tejas!

251
00:28:46,237 --> 00:28:47,562
Open up!

252
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:51,937
Open the door!

253
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:55,687
Come on!

254
00:28:56,695 --> 00:29:00,520
Tejas. Please open the door!

255
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:13,187
Are you listening?

256
00:29:22,695 --> 00:29:24,770
- Grandma? - Tejas.

257
00:29:25,737 --> 00:29:27,062
Open the door!

258
00:29:33,653 --> 00:29:35,395
Who is in there?

259
00:29:36,445 --> 00:29:37,937
That crazy girl!

260
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:39,853
She just ran inside.

261
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:43,770
Open the door!

262
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:09,652
What are you guys up to?

263
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:11,861
- Whose is this? - I don't know.

264
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:13,027
Whose is this?

265
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,020
- I don't know! - Is it Natasha's?

266
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:16,270
No.

267
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,652
- I'm asking for the last time! Is it hers? - How can it be hers?

268
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:23,736
- Why not? She may have forgotten it here. - I don't know whose it is.

269
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:25,569
- Really? - Yes.

270
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,603
- Really? - I said I don't!

271
00:30:29,612 --> 00:30:31,103
I will hit you!

272
00:30:31,403 --> 00:30:33,270
- Don't you know? - No.

273
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,812
Don't you? Wait.

274
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,937
- Don't break that! - Why not?

275
00:30:37,945 --> 00:30:39,736
- It's expensive. - How much is it?

276
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,645
Fifty five thousand rupees.

277
00:30:42,987 --> 00:30:45,687
How will I watch Raj Kapoor's movies?

278
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,562
I know you are sleeping with her.

279
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,770
I will catch you red-handed, one day.

280
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,770
You like <i>Boomerang, </i>isn't it?

281
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,562
You kiss like a child.

282
00:33:14,653 --> 00:33:16,069
Eat her, why don't you?

283
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:20,020
You are lying to me.

284
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,402
You text her in my class.

285
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:26,562
You were glued to each other at the Comedy Club!

286
00:33:26,987 --> 00:33:28,569
Do you think I'm blind?

287
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,603
Did you play Raj Kapoor's songs for her as well?

288
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:39,145
You did, right?

289
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:49,853
Don't mock me!

290
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,187
I didn't realize

291
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:54,103
you would be so hurt.

292
00:33:56,028 --> 00:34:00,187
She is just using you!

293
00:34:01,112 --> 00:34:04,437
She is just showing-off.

294
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:08,187
On Instagram, Twitter... She wants to show-off.

295
00:34:08,737 --> 00:34:11,812
She is using you like an Instagram filter.

296
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:14,069
You are the filter today.

297
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,978
Tomorrow, it will be Rahul.

298
00:34:17,153 --> 00:34:18,770
Don't laugh.

299
00:34:19,362 --> 00:34:21,603
You should break up with her.

300
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:32,228
Do what you want.

301
00:34:39,528 --> 00:34:42,694
- I didn't realize you would be hurt. - Why are you repeating yourself?

302
00:34:42,695 --> 00:34:47,437
I didn't realize you loved me so much.

303
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,687
I want to be with you.

304
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:54,187
- I will leave her for you. - Have you lost it?

305
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,312
I'm married!

306
00:36:19,987 --> 00:36:21,562
Please hand me a towel.

307
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,187
Not going to shower?

308
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,728
Dirty bitch!

309
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,520
Naked dog!

310
00:39:13,737 --> 00:39:15,603
How are you, Sudha?

311
00:39:15,737 --> 00:39:17,853
- All good? - Yes.

312
00:39:20,403 --> 00:39:22,187
Bless you.

313
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,986
You look very pretty.

314
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,652
Ajit said you are taking good care of the house.

315
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:28,937
- There are fragile things in that. - Okay.

316
00:39:28,987 --> 00:39:30,353
Okay?

317
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:33,978
The house is very clean.

318
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:42,062
- Do you need anything? - First, I will take a shower.

319
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:44,395
Take it.

320
00:39:44,528 --> 00:39:47,228
It's so humid here!

321
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:51,194
- Sudha! Put the water heater on. - Okay.

322
00:39:51,195 --> 00:39:53,353
Listen, should I give her these?

323
00:39:53,612 --> 00:39:55,812
- Give her one. - Okay.

324
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,853
Keep this bag inside.

325
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:03,437
This is for you.

326
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:05,728
Okay?

327
00:40:19,237 --> 00:40:20,770
Come.

328
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:27,062
<i>Close the left nostril and inhale using the right nostril.</i>

329
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:31,812
<i>Now close the right nostril and exhale using the left nostril.</i>

330
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:37,062
<i>Again, close the right nostril and inhale through the left nostril.</i>

331
00:40:37,945 --> 00:40:39,777
<i>Now close the left nostril...</i>

332
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:42,694
<i>Four terrorists killed in Bandipore district of Jammu & Kashmir</i>

333
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:45,020
<i>while attempting to attack a pilgrimage...</i>

334
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:47,145
- And? - Three.

335
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:50,402
I have entered the number.

336
00:40:50,403 --> 00:40:52,645
Wait for the password.

337
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:46,603
I'll get it.

338
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,569
- Come in. - Greetings.

339
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,111
- Greetings! - Welcome.

340
00:41:52,112 --> 00:41:53,937
- Greetings. - Greetings.

341
00:41:56,278 --> 00:41:58,645
- Hi, dear. Come. - Hello.

342
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:00,736
- Hello. - Hello...

343
00:42:00,737 --> 00:42:03,020
- Did you find parking? - Yes.

344
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,312
Please sit.

345
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,520
- Please. - Sit.

346
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:12,978
You guys are early. People are always late in Mumbai.

347
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,902
We left after the peak hours and the roads were empty today.

348
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:19,819
We've been to this neighborhood before.

349
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,937
- I see. - I didn't remember earlier.

350
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:25,361
But when we entered

351
00:42:25,362 --> 00:42:28,402
I remembered that her cousin used to live here.

352
00:42:28,403 --> 00:42:30,736
My cousin's wife's family.

353
00:42:30,737 --> 00:42:32,027
- Sorry. - I see.

354
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:34,437
- People are decent here. - Absolutely.

355
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,527
You're lucky to find a house in this kind of locality.

356
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:41,611
He has this one-bedroom flat because he's a bachelor.

357
00:42:41,612 --> 00:42:43,812
The other flats are nice too.

358
00:42:45,487 --> 00:42:46,444
Yes.

359
00:42:46,445 --> 00:42:50,361
He comes home just to sleep. Look at the mess here.

360
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:53,236
I have asked him to hang a painting at least.

361
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,819
I keep busy.

362
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,312
I am happy that he got the house painted.

363
00:42:59,403 --> 00:43:04,728
Guys are always reluctant. They deserve praise if they eat properly.

364
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,652
Will you have tea or cold drinks?

365
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,145
Lemonade?

366
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:12,645
Ma'am...

367
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:14,812
- Some tea for us. - Yes.

368
00:43:18,987 --> 00:43:22,027
Has Ajit taken you on a tour of Mumbai yet?

369
00:43:22,028 --> 00:43:23,194
Sudha.

370
00:43:23,195 --> 00:43:24,777
Make six cups of tea

371
00:43:24,778 --> 00:43:28,020
and serve some snacks in the new bowls.

372
00:43:28,403 --> 00:43:29,986
I was posted here.

373
00:43:29,987 --> 00:43:32,062
Where?

374
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:34,902
Dungarsi Road.

375
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,569
He has started with his stories!

376
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:41,270
We used to live in the same area. Just behind the Opera House.

377
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:43,978
We moved to Andheri after we got married.

378
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:46,520
But Mumbai has changed a lot.

379
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:47,986
Everything has.

380
00:43:47,987 --> 00:43:50,145
So has Meerut.

381
00:43:50,153 --> 00:43:51,986
It's so green now.

382
00:43:51,987 --> 00:43:55,236
Mr. Manoj, your area is nice too.

383
00:43:55,237 --> 00:43:58,187
It's an old building but there is greenery around.

384
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,437
Like, you have sea views. We have tree views.

385
00:44:06,195 --> 00:44:08,236
It's a good one!

386
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:10,277
You are a "Jokey" man.

387
00:44:10,278 --> 00:44:11,986
The word is "Jovial".

388
00:44:11,987 --> 00:44:13,319
They are the same.

389
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,527
My sister-in-law's family speaks highly of you.

390
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,944
Your brother-in-law is married into that family, right?

391
00:44:18,945 --> 00:44:22,270
They are the reason we are here.

392
00:44:22,653 --> 00:44:25,437
- Do you come to Mumbai often? - Not really.

393
00:44:25,445 --> 00:44:27,444
Once a year.

394
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:31,478
But Ajit comes to Meerut on festivals.

395
00:44:32,028 --> 00:44:36,853
- Whenever he gets a break. - Diwali must be spectacular in Meerut!

396
00:44:37,195 --> 00:44:41,194
- Absolutely! We get new outfits made. - I see.

397
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:44,895
- We hold Lakshmi puja... - We do that too.

398
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,736
And they play cards. It's a cosmopolitan kind of Diwali!

399
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:53,694
We have a Ram Leela performance there. Ajit had played Ravana once!

400
00:44:53,695 --> 00:44:54,986
Ravana!

401
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,027
He forgot some lines!

402
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,478
He was so nervous.

403
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,277
We will be right back.

404
00:45:03,278 --> 00:45:06,694
Let me show her the house.

405
00:45:06,695 --> 00:45:08,611
- My small flat. - Sure.

406
00:45:08,612 --> 00:45:10,687
Go ahead.

407
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:21,444
They talk constantly.

408
00:45:21,445 --> 00:45:24,187
Aparna told me that they have met twice.

409
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:27,611
Nowadays, things are finalized at coffee shops.

410
00:45:27,612 --> 00:45:30,402
- Marriages, business deals. - Right.

411
00:45:30,403 --> 00:45:33,187
Even divorces!

412
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:36,937
- Why are you talking about divorce? - Why not? It's a fact of life

413
00:45:37,028 --> 00:45:39,111
We will not get divorced.

414
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:41,694
Come on!

415
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:43,603
Never!

416
00:45:43,737 --> 00:45:45,569
They are a good match.

417
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,736
Similar lifestyles and values.

418
00:45:48,737 --> 00:45:52,353
The same profession. It's great.

419
00:45:52,612 --> 00:45:55,402
- But mutual understanding is vital. - Correct.

420
00:45:55,403 --> 00:45:58,027
- If they want to be together... - That is very important.

421
00:45:58,028 --> 00:45:59,270
True.

422
00:45:59,278 --> 00:46:05,270
We saw Aparna for the first time at Mr. Pramod's funeral.

423
00:46:05,653 --> 00:46:07,520
- Were you there? - Yes.

424
00:46:07,653 --> 00:46:10,020
He was close to us.

425
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,902
He loved Ajit dearly.

426
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:14,194
He was a good man.

427
00:46:14,195 --> 00:46:17,736
He introduced us to the astrologer. We really believe in him.

428
00:46:17,737 --> 00:46:19,395
You have faith in him.

429
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:21,486
We showed him our horoscopes.

430
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,819
- He told us so many things! - Here comes the tea!

431
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,353
Please come.

432
00:46:28,945 --> 00:46:31,562
Did you add sugar? One more.

433
00:46:33,778 --> 00:46:36,895
- Let him. - He has diabetes.

434
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:40,645
They are a great match.

435
00:46:42,153 --> 00:46:44,270
Their horoscopes are compatible.

436
00:46:45,862 --> 00:46:47,562
Serve them inside.

437
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,562
She makes very good tea.

438
00:46:53,862 --> 00:46:55,437
It is very nice.

439
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,812
People prefer tea bags these days.

440
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,978
Does she cook?

441
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:04,937
She does, but not too well.

442
00:47:04,945 --> 00:47:06,736
And do you cook?

443
00:47:06,737 --> 00:47:10,187
- Yes, but not non-veg dishes. - Are you a vegetarian?

444
00:47:12,153 --> 00:47:14,645
Yes, but Ajit is a carnivore.

445
00:47:22,695 --> 00:47:25,520
The guy has a small brain!

446
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,312
I'm good.

447
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:24,270
Put it there.

448
00:48:43,695 --> 00:48:45,103
Ajit?

449
00:48:45,127 --> 00:48:55,127
<b>WwW.ZoCine.CoM Watch Movies And Series!</b>

450
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:11,270
- Mom, should we go? - Did you show her the house?

451
00:49:11,528 --> 00:49:14,937
- What do you think? - Are you ready to give up chicken?

452
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:18,853
Congratulations!

453
00:49:20,195 --> 00:49:24,444
- Congratulations to you too! - Congratulations.

454
00:49:24,445 --> 00:49:28,853
I knew things would work out today, so I got some sweets.

455
00:49:29,237 --> 00:49:30,812
God bless you!

456
00:49:31,195 --> 00:49:33,652
I will talk to my astrologer and call you tomorrow.

457
00:49:33,653 --> 00:49:34,986
- Yes, please. - Definitely.

458
00:49:34,987 --> 00:49:36,236
Ajit!

459
00:49:36,237 --> 00:49:38,645
There is no need!

460
00:49:38,903 --> 00:49:41,652
- We'll meet again. - Sure.

461
00:49:41,653 --> 00:49:43,986
- Congratulations once again. - To you too.

462
00:49:43,987 --> 00:49:46,236
- Keep in touch. - Sure.

463
00:49:46,237 --> 00:49:49,812
Call us, sometime. Okay.

464
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:58,944
Sudha, Ajit is going to get married!

465
00:49:58,945 --> 00:50:03,069
We will finalize the date soon. Congratulations to you too!

466
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,611
Such a good family.

467
00:50:05,612 --> 00:50:08,520
Please take some sweets home.

468
00:51:26,362 --> 00:51:30,444
Only one elevator is working, right? It's a ten-minute wait if we miss it.

469
00:51:30,445 --> 00:51:34,027
I was just about to leave and Ms. Neha gave me some work.

470
00:51:34,028 --> 00:51:37,694
"Dust the painting..." I did that yesterday. She wanted me to do it again!

471
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:40,027
Am I to blame if someone is renovating their home?

472
00:51:40,028 --> 00:51:42,986
"Sweep the balcony, water the plants..." Annoying.

473
00:51:42,987 --> 00:51:44,978
Should I show you something?

474
00:51:50,737 --> 00:51:52,728
Ms. Neha gave it to me.

475
00:51:56,487 --> 00:51:58,270
Beautiful, isn't it?

476
00:52:00,237 --> 00:52:02,770
Pure silk and fully embroidered.

477
00:52:07,487 --> 00:52:10,236
I will fix it or drape a scarf over it.

478
00:52:10,237 --> 00:52:12,312
It will look perfect.

479
00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:15,062
- Absolutely! - Isn't it?

480
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:18,312
I will wear it on my sister's wedding day.

481
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,353
You're not having one?

482
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:50,437
You seem to have had a good day.

483
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,562
Help!

484
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:27,312
Why can't you swim?

485
00:54:27,862 --> 00:54:30,062
My dad wasn't a Country Club member.

486
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,687
- How do I look? - Like a mother of two.

487
00:54:36,778 --> 00:54:38,103
Tea!

488
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,562
I'm not that fat.

489
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,736
<i>A woman's heart is lighter?</i>

490
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:45,353
But it beats faster. There are 11 more differences.

491
00:55:48,737 --> 00:55:51,687
The girls didn't even call me once.

492
00:55:52,362 --> 00:55:54,478
They binge-watching a show?

493
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,812
You are not going to be content...

494
00:56:21,362 --> 00:56:22,486
Talk to me.

495
00:56:22,487 --> 00:56:23,978
<i>Do you have a minute?</i>

496
00:56:24,862 --> 00:56:26,353
Sure.

497
00:56:26,862 --> 00:56:28,353
<i>Where are you?</i>

498
00:56:30,028 --> 00:56:31,270
I...

499
00:56:31,653 --> 00:56:33,103
<i>Where are you?</i>

500
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,562
At the beach house.

501
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,353
<i>I'm coming over.</i>

502
00:56:40,195 --> 00:56:43,145
Where are you, Salman?

503
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:44,812
<i>I'm coming.</i>

504
00:56:44,862 --> 00:56:45,819
Now?

505
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:49,187
We decided that you will come after the housewarming!

506
00:56:50,528 --> 00:56:52,437
Did you send me an email?

507
00:56:52,737 --> 00:56:54,145
What about?

508
00:57:01,028 --> 00:57:03,736
<i>I will email you all the details.</i>

509
00:57:03,737 --> 00:57:06,319
<i>- I will introduce you to Hardik.</i> - Who is he?

510
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,694
<i>My lawyer.</i>

511
00:57:07,695 --> 00:57:10,645
What do I say to him?

512
00:57:13,112 --> 00:57:15,812
- Why are you laughing? <i>- That is the issue.</i>

513
00:57:18,445 --> 00:57:20,353
<i>What I mean is...</i>

514
00:57:21,487 --> 00:57:24,069
<i>you will take care of the girls after I am gone.</i>

515
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,728
What do you mean?

516
00:57:30,195 --> 00:57:31,770
<i>Forget it, Sudhir!</i>

517
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:34,770
Salman!

518
00:57:35,778 --> 00:57:39,152
<i>You will take care of them after I am gone.</i>

519
00:57:39,153 --> 00:57:41,728
Where are you going? Where are you now?

520
00:57:43,445 --> 00:57:45,478
<i>On my balcony, drinking.</i>

521
00:57:45,612 --> 00:57:49,062
<i>There is no one to give me ice for the whiskey.</i>

522
00:57:49,278 --> 00:57:53,103
Where are the girls?

523
00:57:53,153 --> 00:57:57,145
<i>- Watching a movie with the nanny, I guess.</i> - Did they have dinner?

524
00:57:58,362 --> 00:58:00,270
<i>Why don't you ask their mother?</i>

525
00:58:01,653 --> 00:58:05,687
<i>The girls could be starving! Where is the mother? Who is she with?</i>

526
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,902
<i>And why is her location service disabled?</i>

527
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:10,819
- What are you talking about? - <i>Sudhir...</i>

528
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,645
<i>Sudhir, Reena is bored of me.</i>

529
00:58:17,403 --> 00:58:18,937
<i>- Got it?</i> - Salman...

530
00:58:22,737 --> 00:58:24,645
Listen to yourself!

531
00:58:28,487 --> 00:58:32,645
<i>In 13 years of our marriage, she was happy for only 11 months.</i>

532
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:41,520
<i>I bet, she will not answer my call.</i>

533
00:58:43,862 --> 00:58:46,062
- Salman, stop the drama. <i>- Sudhir, listen...</i>

534
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,062
<i>Listen...</i>

535
00:58:57,278 --> 00:58:59,111
- Salman. <i>- She will not take the call!</i>

536
00:58:59,112 --> 00:59:01,020
<i>I bet.</i>

537
00:59:04,153 --> 00:59:06,353
<i>What if I was in an accident?</i>

538
00:59:07,237 --> 00:59:08,853
You have lost it!

539
00:59:22,403 --> 00:59:24,687
<i>Let the boring husband die!</i>

540
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,895
<i>Are you listening?</i>

541
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:42,020
<i>Enjoy your beach life.</i>

542
01:00:01,403 --> 01:00:03,812
Find out what's wrong.

543
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:05,228
Nothing is wrong.

544
01:00:05,445 --> 01:00:06,645
He is pretending.

545
01:00:10,862 --> 01:00:12,978
Don't tell him I asked you to.

546
01:00:36,112 --> 01:00:37,645
What is it, Salman?

547
01:00:44,028 --> 01:00:48,603
- You can call Sudhir up but not me. <i>- He is my buddy. I have every right!</i>

548
01:00:50,737 --> 01:00:51,937
I'm at Geeta's.

549
01:00:52,403 --> 01:00:53,812
Have you gone nuts?

550
01:00:54,028 --> 01:00:56,228
<i>Assume I have.</i>

551
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,145
<i>Tell me this.</i>

552
01:00:58,653 --> 01:01:05,520
<i>Why did Geeta tell me that things are not okay between us</i>

553
01:01:07,028 --> 01:01:09,145
<i>and that you are not at her place?</i>

554
01:01:11,903 --> 01:01:13,478
<i>Why did she say that?</i>

555
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:16,062
<i>Reena.</i>

556
01:01:23,737 --> 01:01:25,020
He knows.

557
01:01:26,237 --> 01:01:27,645
How?

558
01:01:29,695 --> 01:01:30,937
How?

559
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,353
Geeta told him that I'm not with her.

560
01:01:34,487 --> 01:01:36,819
What else has she told him?

561
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,937
How would I know?

562
01:01:45,028 --> 01:01:48,145
We don't send each other messages or emails!

563
01:01:48,695 --> 01:01:50,527
We meet once in a while.

564
01:01:50,528 --> 01:01:53,527
- Are we being followed? - We are not.

565
01:01:53,528 --> 01:01:55,687
Otherwise, he wouldn't have called Geeta.

566
01:02:01,778 --> 01:02:03,562
What did you tell Geeta?

567
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:07,478
I texted her that I was going on a tour with my HSBC colleague.

568
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,603
I feel guilty.

569
01:02:15,653 --> 01:02:17,228
What have I become?

570
01:02:17,862 --> 01:02:20,687
My children are hungry and my husband is spying on me.

571
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,895
Not Geeta, I'm the bitch.

572
01:02:29,653 --> 01:02:31,812
Tell him you are here.

573
01:02:32,903 --> 01:02:36,062
Tell him you are here to talk to me.

574
01:02:36,737 --> 01:02:37,944
What about?

575
01:02:37,945 --> 01:02:41,770
About your fights. Okay?

576
01:02:42,112 --> 01:02:46,395
End this Geeta chapter now

577
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,562
or you'll be caught in a lie.

578
01:02:48,778 --> 01:02:51,937
Tell him that you came to me for advice.

579
01:02:57,278 --> 01:02:58,562
<i>You hung up on me?</i>

580
01:03:03,778 --> 01:03:05,853
- At Sudhir's. <i>- What!</i>

581
01:03:07,445 --> 01:03:09,645
- At his beach house. <i>- What!</i>

582
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:13,062
<i>You're there before the housewarming?</i>

583
01:03:14,778 --> 01:03:16,937
- I needed to talk. - <i>About what?</i>

584
01:03:19,903 --> 01:03:21,353
About us...

585
01:03:21,528 --> 01:03:24,312
Our fights.

586
01:03:29,987 --> 01:03:32,694
<i>Do I go to him and rat on you?</i>

587
01:03:32,695 --> 01:03:35,187
<i>In 12 years of our marriage, I didn't bore you for 10 months.</i>

588
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:37,228
<i>Do you know why?</i>

589
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:44,978
In a party.

590
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:49,437
<i>At the Kishore Thadani one, last week?</i>

591
01:03:50,362 --> 01:03:51,402
Yes.

592
01:03:51,403 --> 01:03:56,027
<i>Reena, Kishore came to our house</i>

593
01:03:56,028 --> 01:03:57,978
<i>and you were seeking sympathy?</i>

594
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,486
<i>What else?</i>

595
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,020
<i>Kishore Thadani of Sunrise Capital!</i>

596
01:04:03,987 --> 01:04:06,319
<i>He will invest 200 crore rupees in my company!</i>

597
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,812
<i>12 years as a banker and you have learned nothing!</i>

598
01:04:15,237 --> 01:04:16,902
<i>Our daughters' education.</i>

599
01:04:16,903 --> 01:04:19,770
<i>Dad's 10 crore rupees loan and the debt!</i>

600
01:04:21,987 --> 01:04:23,152
You or I?

601
01:04:23,153 --> 01:04:25,437
It's a 2 crore loan.

602
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,812
You have selfish motives.

603
01:04:28,945 --> 01:04:35,062
Kishore, the beach house and me... We are trophies for you!

604
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,312
I'm coming home.

605
01:04:43,612 --> 01:04:45,103
<i>What if I don't?</i>

606
01:04:46,528 --> 01:04:47,652
What do you mean?

607
01:04:47,653 --> 01:04:51,395
<i>You said I like to collect trophies.</i>

608
01:04:51,612 --> 01:04:54,062
<i>What will you do if I stop collecting them?</i>

609
01:04:54,903 --> 01:04:56,812
I will live my life.

610
01:04:58,445 --> 01:04:59,770
<i>What is it about?</i>

611
01:05:00,903 --> 01:05:02,728
<i>Branch Manager, MG Road!</i>

612
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,937
<i>Tell me. What is its worth?</i>

613
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:11,437
<i>Your life is</i>

614
01:05:11,778 --> 01:05:14,270
<i>what I permit it to be. Nothing more.</i>

615
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,228
<i>What kind of life will you have without me?</i>

616
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:30,895
<i>The girls are hungry. Come home.</i>

617
01:05:40,612 --> 01:05:42,103
<i>That's enough.</i>

618
01:05:42,278 --> 01:05:43,478
<i>Come back.</i>

619
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,728
<i>Reena?</i>

620
01:06:10,778 --> 01:06:11,978
Sudhir,

621
01:06:13,945 --> 01:06:15,645
should we tell Salman?

622
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:17,437
About what?

623
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,270
Start working again.

624
01:06:32,362 --> 01:06:34,770
Half of your problems will be solved.

625
01:06:38,945 --> 01:06:40,937
What about the remaining half?

626
01:06:42,403 --> 01:06:47,728
Salman told me that I should be happy that he has granted me freedom.

627
01:06:54,653 --> 01:06:56,562
Let's just tell him about it.

628
01:06:59,653 --> 01:07:01,603
What's so complex here?

629
01:07:03,612 --> 01:07:05,978
- It's not? - This is life.

630
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:10,187
This is an allowance.

631
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:13,270
You know Salman.

632
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,562
- He talks shit and forgets about it. - I don't.

633
01:07:26,653 --> 01:07:28,353
He will be here soon.

634
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:37,103
- What? - I told him to come over.

635
01:07:38,695 --> 01:07:40,103
Who did you call?

636
01:07:41,362 --> 01:07:44,062
You should have told me.

637
01:07:44,487 --> 01:07:45,812
How could you do this?

638
01:07:48,653 --> 01:07:50,603
Is this not about me as well?

639
01:07:51,362 --> 01:07:53,145
- Get dressed! - I am dressed!

640
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:56,937
He wasn't supposed to come here before the housewarming!

641
01:07:58,112 --> 01:07:59,562
Why are you laughing?

642
01:07:59,945 --> 01:08:01,478
Get dressed!

643
01:08:11,028 --> 01:08:12,194
Wear them.

644
01:08:12,195 --> 01:08:13,437
Why?

645
01:08:14,278 --> 01:08:15,694
You always wear them at home.

646
01:08:15,695 --> 01:08:18,562
- Not here. - I don't want him to notice.

647
01:08:21,153 --> 01:08:25,520
What has Salman got to do with our relationship?

648
01:08:26,987 --> 01:08:29,145
Stop being childish!

649
01:08:29,695 --> 01:08:32,312
I knew that you had a crush on me in college.

650
01:08:33,112 --> 01:08:34,562
Did you ever talk to me?

651
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:39,277
If Salman didn't make a scene. At Jamshed's party,

652
01:08:39,278 --> 01:08:40,895
would you have dropped me off?

653
01:08:46,237 --> 01:08:48,187
Would you have kissed me

654
01:08:48,737 --> 01:08:50,520
if I wasn't Salman's wife?

655
01:08:53,445 --> 01:08:56,603
Can we meet again if Salman learns about us?

656
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:02,395
Sudhir,

657
01:09:02,903 --> 01:09:04,728
if he learns the truth...

658
01:09:07,987 --> 01:09:09,603
Our marriage will end.

659
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,402
What about your daughters?

660
01:09:18,403 --> 01:09:21,236
Why do you always involve them?

661
01:09:21,237 --> 01:09:23,277
- Am I not supposed to? - No.

662
01:09:23,278 --> 01:09:26,853
They will be raised as children of divorced parents are.

663
01:09:31,945 --> 01:09:34,020
I'm done, Sudhir.

664
01:09:36,195 --> 01:09:40,520
I cannot take this anymore.

665
01:09:41,987 --> 01:09:45,277
If you want a divorce, what is the point in telling him?

666
01:09:45,278 --> 01:09:48,478
When he sees us together after our divorce...

667
01:09:51,403 --> 01:09:53,937
Us together?

668
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,020
Yes.

669
01:10:17,403 --> 01:10:18,687
Yes.

670
01:10:25,195 --> 01:10:26,895
Forward the email to me.

671
01:10:28,028 --> 01:10:29,520
Alright?

672
01:10:29,903 --> 01:10:31,228
Okay then. Bye.

673
01:10:35,403 --> 01:10:36,937
It's nice.

674
01:10:37,653 --> 01:10:41,062
I repainted the walls.

675
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:43,736
The contractor's dog died. So the work stalled.

676
01:10:43,737 --> 01:10:45,277
It looks empty, doesn't it?

677
01:10:45,278 --> 01:10:46,687
Empty is good!

678
01:10:46,903 --> 01:10:48,270
We all need space.

679
01:10:48,737 --> 01:10:51,937
- Get me a house like this. - Yours is better, pal!

680
01:10:52,278 --> 01:10:55,527
But I have no voice there.

681
01:10:55,528 --> 01:10:57,520
Even this house belonged to a couple.

682
01:11:08,903 --> 01:11:11,187
She looks pretty in your house.

683
01:11:15,028 --> 01:11:16,895
How much did it cost you?

684
01:11:17,778 --> 01:11:20,520
Not much. It belonged to a couple

685
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:23,978
and I got a good deal out of the property separation.

686
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:30,520
- What does Kishore Thadani have to say? - He's your friend. You will know better.

687
01:11:30,612 --> 01:11:32,312
He is. Keep at it.

688
01:11:34,112 --> 01:11:36,319
She is up to something.

689
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,895
- You provoke her. - Really?

690
01:11:39,903 --> 01:11:41,902
You just know her version.

691
01:11:41,903 --> 01:11:44,777
- No one hears me out. - Did she?

692
01:11:44,778 --> 01:11:46,562
No!

693
01:11:46,945 --> 01:11:48,395
She always talks back.

694
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,478
"I gave up my career for you and the kids!

695
01:11:51,862 --> 01:11:53,728
I could have been something!"

696
01:11:53,903 --> 01:11:56,694
She's the Queen of "Could Have Been".

697
01:11:56,695 --> 01:11:59,228
Could've been a CEO, a film star or an Olympian!

698
01:11:59,445 --> 01:12:01,145
No matter what...

699
01:12:01,278 --> 01:12:03,486
You must not use the word "Allowance" with her.

700
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:05,020
But why did she lie...

701
01:12:05,903 --> 01:12:07,395
So what? She is Reena!

702
01:12:08,403 --> 01:12:09,777
Don't you get her?

703
01:12:09,778 --> 01:12:11,694
She was the most sought after girl in college.

704
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:13,812
No one had the balls to ask her out.

705
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:16,937
Except you.

706
01:12:17,903 --> 01:12:21,187
Handling family matters is not my forte.

707
01:12:21,612 --> 01:12:25,361
Talk to her lovingly and take her home.

708
01:12:25,362 --> 01:12:27,228
Didn't you get married as well?

709
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:31,353
Don't you know?

710
01:12:32,362 --> 01:12:33,562
How could I?

711
01:12:34,612 --> 01:12:38,694
Your mom sent me the invitation card six months after I got married.

712
01:12:38,695 --> 01:12:40,569
I ate veg <i>Biryani</i> at your wedding.

713
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:44,736
You went away for a year and then I heard about your divorce.

714
01:12:44,737 --> 01:12:46,728
It has been ten years now! Forget it.

715
01:12:47,153 --> 01:12:48,687
You have bigger worries.

716
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,437
Sometimes I feel like...

717
01:12:53,862 --> 01:12:55,353
What did she say?

718
01:12:56,278 --> 01:12:57,978
"She cannot live with me."

719
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,520
Should I divorce her?

720
01:13:04,278 --> 01:13:06,062
Have you lost it?

721
01:13:17,778 --> 01:13:18,978
Listen.

722
01:13:19,653 --> 01:13:21,853
You will never find anyone better.

723
01:13:24,195 --> 01:13:27,312
Everything! She loves your daughters.

724
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:35,770
- You cannot live without her. - But

725
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:37,853
Kishore Thadani had come home

726
01:13:39,112 --> 01:13:41,027
and she was crying.

727
01:13:41,028 --> 01:13:42,944
When did that happen?

728
01:13:42,945 --> 01:13:44,478
You were right there!

729
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,520
How could she?

730
01:13:55,445 --> 01:13:58,277
Let's watch an action movie tonight. What do you think, Reena?

731
01:13:58,278 --> 01:13:59,895
Sure. Catch a late night show.

732
01:14:02,903 --> 01:14:04,319
It's only a suggestion.

733
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,770
You only suggest the things you want to do.

734
01:14:16,945 --> 01:14:19,978
I sat through that boring movie you took me to.

735
01:14:20,028 --> 01:14:22,770
I didn't complain.

736
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:27,020
You had decided not to like it.

737
01:14:27,278 --> 01:14:28,728
Who decided this?

738
01:14:29,112 --> 01:14:32,853
A movie should entertain. It should display patriotism or love.

739
01:14:33,237 --> 01:14:36,478
You like open-ended movies and I, black and white.

740
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,194
I'm tired!

741
01:14:39,195 --> 01:14:41,603
Both of you are.

742
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:44,020
Eat and go to bed.

743
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,562
Am I an idiot?

744
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:47,944
I drove all the way here.

745
01:14:47,945 --> 01:14:52,069
You're wise and I'm an idiot.

746
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,652
- Keep saying it. - I will.

747
01:14:53,653 --> 01:14:55,902
Remember that guy

748
01:14:55,903 --> 01:14:58,812
- who would say everything three times? - Yes.

749
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:00,812
He was so strange!

750
01:15:02,612 --> 01:15:05,312
The waiter got three plates of food.

751
01:15:07,862 --> 01:15:09,027
What would he say?

752
01:15:09,028 --> 01:15:11,562
Thapar is going to...

753
01:15:15,445 --> 01:15:16,986
- Where is he now? - Dallas.

754
01:15:16,987 --> 01:15:19,395
He sold his startup and is living it up there.

755
01:15:19,903 --> 01:15:23,103
Let's plan a reunion. Start a group.

756
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:27,478
Those were the days! The coffee and the movies!

757
01:15:28,112 --> 01:15:31,312
This guy introduced me to black coffee.

758
01:15:31,612 --> 01:15:34,312
- I was broke. He took care of me. - Sudhir...

759
01:15:38,487 --> 01:15:40,145
Can Salman and I talk?

760
01:15:43,153 --> 01:15:44,937
- Here or... - Yes.

761
01:15:47,612 --> 01:15:50,187
- Is it comfortable here? - It is.

762
01:16:08,945 --> 01:16:10,228
He is right.

763
01:16:10,862 --> 01:16:12,520
Wash your hands. Let's go home.

764
01:16:43,487 --> 01:16:46,312
<i>Heart Matters. Your YouTube channel.</i>

765
01:16:48,653 --> 01:16:50,187
<i>But how...</i>

766
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:54,444
<i>I always wanted to be an IAS officer.</i>

767
01:16:54,445 --> 01:16:56,694
<i>My father taught in a Government school.</i>

768
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,937
<i>That is where I went to study.</i>

769
01:17:00,945 --> 01:17:04,353
<i>Maybe, that is why my English accent is...</i>

770
01:17:19,737 --> 01:17:21,603
It's not that simple.

771
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:28,687
I get irritated with you.

772
01:17:29,487 --> 01:17:30,812
How?

773
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:34,812
I feel stuck.

774
01:17:36,987 --> 01:17:38,687
What does that mean?

775
01:17:41,362 --> 01:17:43,937
Tell me what the problem is.

776
01:17:44,237 --> 01:17:46,520
You need a mother, not a wife.

777
01:17:49,112 --> 01:17:50,478
I can't do it.

778
01:17:57,487 --> 01:18:00,728
Sudhir saw me crying at Jamshed's party

779
01:18:01,945 --> 01:18:04,187
not at Kishore Thadani's.

780
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:09,103
Sudhir and I

781
01:18:11,445 --> 01:18:13,312
have been together for three years.

782
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,895
Sudhir Batra? Indiabulls?

783
01:18:27,695 --> 01:18:30,611
<i>My father suffered a stroke.</i>

784
01:18:30,612 --> 01:18:34,728
<i>We could not afford the treatment. He passed away.</i>

785
01:18:35,237 --> 01:18:39,270
<i>That is when I decided to be a heart surgeon.</i>

786
01:18:41,237 --> 01:18:44,687
<i>So it all started with a tragedy.</i>

787
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:48,562
<i>Let me tell you...</i>

788
01:18:59,695 --> 01:19:00,978
Sudhir?

789
01:19:24,903 --> 01:19:29,603
<i>It is a reversible process. Take care of it and you will be fine.</i>

790
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:32,728
<i>We are there to mend its flaws.</i>

791
01:19:32,945 --> 01:19:36,228
<i>But I have been more concerned...</i>

792
01:19:38,778 --> 01:19:40,645
Salman wants to talk.

793
01:20:09,028 --> 01:20:10,603
Thadani texted.

794
01:20:11,945 --> 01:20:13,187
<i>"Hi Salman."</i>

795
01:20:21,695 --> 01:20:23,645
<i>"Take good care of my money."</i>

796
01:20:43,695 --> 01:20:45,062
Yes.

797
01:20:48,987 --> 01:20:50,395
I'm exhausted.

798
01:20:50,945 --> 01:20:53,103
Crash here.

799
01:20:54,487 --> 01:20:55,853
I'll show you the bedroom.

800
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:55,645
What are the plans for Saturday?

801
01:23:56,445 --> 01:23:57,520
Your call.

802
01:23:58,278 --> 01:23:59,520
Golf?

803
01:23:59,695 --> 01:24:02,437
Let's have lunch with Ranjeet after that.

804
01:24:03,028 --> 01:24:04,270
Is he back?

805
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:05,812
How is he doing?

806
01:24:09,153 --> 01:24:10,937
His profile on Tinder says...

807
01:24:13,195 --> 01:24:15,478
He can't even catch a Frisbee.

808
01:24:16,737 --> 01:24:18,694
- Salman. - Thadani's team is visiting today.

809
01:24:18,695 --> 01:24:21,020
I left my sunglasses inside.

810
01:24:21,278 --> 01:24:22,520
Sudhir.

811
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:42,270
- Sudhir... - Not now.

812
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:45,478
We will talk later.

813
01:24:46,403 --> 01:24:47,937
Will I see you again?

814
01:25:05,737 --> 01:25:07,353
He said two things

815
01:25:13,487 --> 01:25:14,812
And he said...

816
01:25:19,862 --> 01:25:21,728
you can't find out

817
01:25:22,653 --> 01:25:24,353
that he knows about us.

818
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,145
- Did you say anything to him? - No.

819
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:08,020
What did I say at Jamshed's party?

820
01:26:08,945 --> 01:26:10,187
Nothing.

821
01:26:11,903 --> 01:26:14,569
- So you guys were... - He called me two days later.

822
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:15,937
I didn't take it.

823
01:26:17,445 --> 01:26:19,819
I called him back after a week.

824
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:21,478
After we fought again?

825
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:25,812
No.

826
01:26:30,445 --> 01:26:32,395
It was a peaceful day.

827
01:26:42,112 --> 01:26:45,145
Libertina! The fish was outstanding!

828
01:27:23,653 --> 01:27:24,728
Ms. Rekha...

829
01:27:25,403 --> 01:27:26,645
Principal.

830
01:27:27,028 --> 01:27:29,437
How's the library?

831
01:27:29,945 --> 01:27:32,194
I got it cleaned.

832
01:27:32,195 --> 01:27:34,444
- The books? - The fans.

833
01:27:34,445 --> 01:27:36,111
Who reads books these days?

834
01:27:36,112 --> 01:27:38,236
The library is always empty.

835
01:27:38,237 --> 01:27:42,812
Come to my office for a cup of tea. I have asked you several times.

836
01:27:43,195 --> 01:27:46,395
I don't drink tea, sir. I have told you this before.

837
01:27:46,903 --> 01:27:48,478
Is that it?

838
01:27:56,945 --> 01:28:01,728
The principal's eyes will pop out one day.

839
01:28:02,987 --> 01:28:04,728
Megha...

840
01:28:04,903 --> 01:28:07,603
Are you having a tough time?

841
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,645
- I can't do it. - I know.

842
01:28:11,195 --> 01:28:12,812
Come. Let me.

843
01:28:15,153 --> 01:28:18,603
Not every person can fire a bullet.

844
01:28:19,403 --> 01:28:21,020
Look at me.

845
01:28:21,028 --> 01:28:23,145
I am an acclaimed marksman.

846
01:28:23,862 --> 01:28:27,478
Be ready to fire one.

847
01:28:28,153 --> 01:28:31,478
- Is it too revealing? - I wish it was.

848
01:28:32,695 --> 01:28:35,069
You are too much!

849
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:36,611
Go! You'll be late!

850
01:28:36,612 --> 01:28:38,353
Good luck, soldier!

851
01:28:39,112 --> 01:28:41,103
- Megha Verma? - Yes?

852
01:28:41,487 --> 01:28:44,611
This is my daughter, Sanditi. Sorry, I'm late for the meeting.

853
01:28:44,612 --> 01:28:45,944
She never told me.

854
01:28:45,945 --> 01:28:48,111
She is an excellent student! I have no complaints.

855
01:28:48,112 --> 01:28:49,353
I have some.

856
01:28:49,987 --> 01:28:52,562
Thank God I checked her phone!

857
01:28:52,945 --> 01:28:54,277
Look what she is up to!

858
01:28:54,278 --> 01:28:56,277
- She's eating ice cream. - I am...

859
01:28:56,278 --> 01:28:58,569
Did you not like the flavor?

860
01:28:58,570 --> 01:29:01,111
This is an all-girls school.

861
01:29:01,112 --> 01:29:03,861
How could she do all this here?

862
01:29:03,862 --> 01:29:06,402
She has uploaded it on telegram.

863
01:29:06,403 --> 01:29:07,694
It's Instagram, Mom!

864
01:29:07,695 --> 01:29:13,103
They participate in debates together. That's how they have become friends.

865
01:29:13,528 --> 01:29:15,236
Please, Ms. Rekha!

866
01:29:15,237 --> 01:29:19,944
You will make them forget our culture!

867
01:29:19,945 --> 01:29:22,444
Such a compliment!

868
01:29:22,445 --> 01:29:23,937
Hold on!

869
01:29:24,028 --> 01:29:26,319
Can you do something about her uniform?

870
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,437
This skirt is too short.

871
01:29:30,987 --> 01:29:33,312
Why not ask them to wear <i>salwar-kameez</i> instead?

872
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,520
It will keep their legs covered.

873
01:29:54,153 --> 01:29:57,062
- Sorry for being late, Paras. - No problem!

874
01:29:59,112 --> 01:30:01,103
I was hanging out with my friend.

875
01:30:11,487 --> 01:30:13,353
So... how are you?

876
01:30:19,278 --> 01:30:21,562
Should we make small talk or get to the point?

877
01:30:22,653 --> 01:30:25,687
Some small talk to start with.

878
01:30:27,612 --> 01:30:29,986
Do you need to use a shawl now?

879
01:30:29,987 --> 01:30:31,319
I am feeling cold.

880
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:34,728
Take it off. You are sweating.

881
01:30:40,403 --> 01:30:42,478
You can keep it on, if you like.

882
01:30:43,695 --> 01:30:44,978
I'm good.

883
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:54,687
This is our third meeting. And this time, without our families.

884
01:30:55,237 --> 01:30:57,861
So I want to speak openly.

885
01:30:57,862 --> 01:30:59,770
Sure.

886
01:31:00,153 --> 01:31:05,020
I'm a little shy. I have never asked a girl for her number.

887
01:31:07,237 --> 01:31:11,062
- No, I did when I took her sari. - What!

888
01:31:11,153 --> 01:31:14,569
"I spilled my drink on her on the train." So, I kept her sari with me.

889
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:16,944
- You took her sari off on the train? - Yes!

890
01:31:16,945 --> 01:31:18,728
No, I mean...

891
01:31:19,028 --> 01:31:21,978
- The next day, I took it to get washed.. - I see.

892
01:31:22,778 --> 01:31:24,603
But the stains were stubborn.

893
01:31:27,362 --> 01:31:29,520
- Can I ask you something? - Of course!

894
01:31:29,903 --> 01:31:32,687
Did you spill the drink intentionally?

895
01:31:34,737 --> 01:31:36,520
Please, Megha.

896
01:31:39,903 --> 01:31:42,819
I studied in an all-boys school. I don't have game.

897
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:45,111
I have heard that all-boys school students

898
01:31:45,112 --> 01:31:49,520
often treat all-girls school students to ice creams.

899
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:51,103
What!

900
01:31:54,987 --> 01:31:57,270
You are smart, Megha.

901
01:31:57,653 --> 01:32:01,687
You are trying to distract me but it won't work.

902
01:32:06,862 --> 01:32:08,270
Shall we get to the point?

903
01:32:08,653 --> 01:32:10,770
- No. - Why not?

904
01:32:11,195 --> 01:32:12,902
He's a nice boy!

905
01:32:12,903 --> 01:32:15,478
He has a good job! He has good values.

906
01:32:15,862 --> 01:32:18,853
He is respectable and respectful.

907
01:32:19,153 --> 01:32:21,853
He is not fair skinned

908
01:32:22,028 --> 01:32:23,937
but you balance that out.

909
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:28,395
So what is the problem?

910
01:32:28,653 --> 01:32:31,569
I cannot judge guys.

911
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:32,853
What do you mean?

912
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:36,478
I did not study in a coed school.

913
01:32:36,987 --> 01:32:39,478
No freedom or allowance.

914
01:32:39,862 --> 01:32:44,444
I wasn't brave enough to meet boys from other schools

915
01:32:44,445 --> 01:32:46,937
or hang out with them

916
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:50,312
or eat ice creams together.

917
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:55,645
That is why I want you

918
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:57,853
to get married.

919
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:00,520
You can have ice cream to your heart's delight.

920
01:33:31,945 --> 01:33:33,895
<i>This is amazing!</i>

921
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:56,228
- Looking for someone? - Friends show up to prank us, I heard.

922
01:33:58,403 --> 01:33:59,812
No one did.

923
01:34:01,195 --> 01:34:02,812
Please come in.

924
01:34:09,112 --> 01:34:11,520
They must have gotten wasted and gone home.

925
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:14,603
- Come on. - What!

926
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:21,395
Sit.

927
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:39,569
If you could be an animal, which one would you be?

928
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:41,228
What kind of a question is that?

929
01:34:41,612 --> 01:34:45,520
At work we ask silly questions a lot. But, it's fun.

930
01:34:47,862 --> 01:34:50,853
- So tell me. - Animal?

931
01:34:52,903 --> 01:34:54,228
A cat.

932
01:34:54,278 --> 01:34:55,603
A cat!

933
01:34:57,362 --> 01:34:59,145
They have nine lives.

934
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:02,645
Seven with me... and an another two!

935
01:35:03,195 --> 01:35:04,562
Meow!

936
01:35:06,778 --> 01:35:09,020
What about you?

937
01:35:11,695 --> 01:35:13,353
An alligator.

938
01:35:14,195 --> 01:35:16,187
The sleeping devil.

939
01:35:16,987 --> 01:35:18,478
Beware! He can bite!

940
01:35:20,945 --> 01:35:22,986
Do you know anything about alligators?

941
01:35:22,987 --> 01:35:24,152
No.

942
01:35:24,153 --> 01:35:26,277
I have watched Nat Geo a lot.

943
01:35:26,278 --> 01:35:30,812
Male alligators blow bubbles in the water.

944
01:35:31,653 --> 01:35:32,687
Really!

945
01:35:33,278 --> 01:35:34,312
Why?

946
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:37,020
To attract the females!

947
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,645
To excite them.

948
01:35:40,278 --> 01:35:42,853
- Do you want some water? - I'm fine!

949
01:35:44,862 --> 01:35:46,770
Okay, I'll have some.

950
01:36:41,653 --> 01:36:43,020
Congratulations.

951
01:37:01,737 --> 01:37:03,395
Are you drying your hair?

952
01:37:11,945 --> 01:37:13,562
Are you drying the clothes?

953
01:37:53,695 --> 01:37:55,812
Are you chopping tomatoes?

954
01:37:55,903 --> 01:37:57,270
No.

955
01:38:13,570 --> 01:38:16,853
Mom is happy as long as the neighbors are.

956
01:38:17,237 --> 01:38:23,152
I will be happy only when I become a grandma of two.

957
01:38:23,153 --> 01:38:26,152
Mom! You never fail to mention that.

958
01:38:26,153 --> 01:38:27,645
Keep quiet.

959
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:29,819
Only us women will understand.

960
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:31,562
- What do you say? - Right.

961
01:38:31,862 --> 01:38:36,187
You guys talk, we are going to go get some air.

962
01:38:42,612 --> 01:38:45,978
Listen to us, Megha.

963
01:38:46,862 --> 01:38:49,069
Look at my other daughter-in-law.

964
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:50,937
She is so happy.

965
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:56,478
She had two kids, one after the other.

966
01:38:56,862 --> 01:38:59,277
She spends the whole day looking after them.

967
01:38:59,278 --> 01:39:01,361
She does not need to break a sweat anymore.

968
01:39:01,362 --> 01:39:04,312
- Break a sweat? - Yes.

969
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:06,562
Listen,

970
01:39:07,153 --> 01:39:10,236
your mother-in-law squawks all day

971
01:39:10,237 --> 01:39:12,520
and the bed squeaks all night.

972
01:39:12,903 --> 01:39:17,395
This will end once you have kids.

973
01:39:19,028 --> 01:39:22,562
When desires are fulfilled, the toil will end.

974
01:39:23,737 --> 01:39:26,853
What if they are not?

975
01:39:27,237 --> 01:39:28,562
Come on!

976
01:39:29,862 --> 01:39:31,187
Tell me something,

977
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:35,103
does a woman desire anything more than a child?

978
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:36,853
No.

979
01:39:37,778 --> 01:39:39,020
There you go.

980
01:39:43,653 --> 01:39:50,770
So this is why you are upset. I noticed

981
01:39:51,528 --> 01:39:53,812
what mom said upset you.

982
01:39:54,528 --> 01:39:58,312
Don't worry about her. We will have a kid later.

983
01:39:58,403 --> 01:40:00,520
We must make love now.

984
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:03,437
Endlessly.

985
01:40:03,737 --> 01:40:06,236
You look so happy after marriage.

986
01:40:06,237 --> 01:40:07,944
You are always excited!

987
01:40:07,945 --> 01:40:09,027
Hey!

988
01:40:09,028 --> 01:40:12,020
So are you.

989
01:40:12,028 --> 01:40:14,270
You are happy, too.

990
01:40:18,653 --> 01:40:21,020
Have you ever watched an adult film?

991
01:40:21,612 --> 01:40:22,770
What?

992
01:40:25,028 --> 01:40:26,353
Have you?

993
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:28,444
Yes.

994
01:40:28,445 --> 01:40:30,277
Back in college.

995
01:40:30,278 --> 01:40:32,645
Even last month... Why?

996
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,603
When the guy says...

997
01:40:43,153 --> 01:40:44,978
And the girl says...

998
01:40:51,653 --> 01:40:54,145
They have a good time together.

999
01:40:54,528 --> 01:40:55,937
Together.

1000
01:40:58,403 --> 01:40:59,645
Yes!

1001
01:40:59,778 --> 01:41:01,937
I have never understood that!

1002
01:41:02,403 --> 01:41:04,361
You either talk or have sex!

1003
01:41:04,362 --> 01:41:06,402
Do either of the two.

1004
01:41:06,403 --> 01:41:08,978
Why do it together?

1005
01:41:09,112 --> 01:41:11,145
At work,

1006
01:41:11,153 --> 01:41:14,069
I either check the accounts or type.

1007
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:15,986
I never do both together.

1008
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:17,603
It doesn't make sense.

1009
01:41:17,612 --> 01:41:19,395
Look! Birds!

1010
01:41:24,362 --> 01:41:26,395
Take these birds for example.

1011
01:41:26,445 --> 01:41:28,694
They either lay eggs or fly.

1012
01:41:28,695 --> 01:41:31,645
Have you seen a flying bird lay eggs?

1013
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:41,103
What's wrong?

1014
01:41:41,987 --> 01:41:43,361
Nothing...

1015
01:41:43,362 --> 01:41:46,103
Megha, the Principal has called you.

1016
01:41:48,278 --> 01:41:49,395
Go.

1017
01:41:53,112 --> 01:41:56,277
Tell me what to do.

1018
01:41:56,278 --> 01:41:59,694
Look at the books in this school! Why would you issue such a book?

1019
01:41:59,695 --> 01:42:01,486
- It was not me... - Hold on.

1020
01:42:01,487 --> 01:42:03,270
She did not issue the book.

1021
01:42:05,737 --> 01:42:08,978
Who else could it be?

1022
01:42:09,362 --> 01:42:12,603
No wonder. She's a divorcee after all.

1023
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:17,187
Let me take a look at it.

1024
01:42:19,028 --> 01:42:20,312
I see.

1025
01:42:21,237 --> 01:42:22,478
What is it about?

1026
01:42:22,862 --> 01:42:24,812
- I have not read it, sir. <i>- Lolita!</i>

1027
01:42:25,403 --> 01:42:29,687
Read it. It is about an incestual relationship.

1028
01:42:30,528 --> 01:42:31,944
So you have read it.

1029
01:42:31,945 --> 01:42:33,353
No!

1030
01:42:33,487 --> 01:42:37,728
I do not read such filthy stories! She and her father have read it!

1031
01:42:41,862 --> 01:42:44,111
Call Ms. Rekha.

1032
01:42:44,112 --> 01:42:45,444
Right.

1033
01:42:45,445 --> 01:42:46,770
Jaswant!

1034
01:42:47,403 --> 01:42:49,603
- Ask Ms. Rekha to come here at once. - Sure.

1035
01:43:49,028 --> 01:43:51,027
This is a wildlife book!

1036
01:43:51,028 --> 01:43:52,111
I have no idea!

1037
01:43:52,112 --> 01:43:53,319
I will fix it.

1038
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:55,020
Where is Ms. Rekha?

1039
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:57,437
Let me check on her.

1040
01:44:58,028 --> 01:45:00,478
It's no big deal!

1041
01:45:02,403 --> 01:45:05,520
Why in the library?

1042
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:08,645
I had two fantasies.

1043
01:45:09,862 --> 01:45:11,770
Let me tell you.

1044
01:45:12,278 --> 01:45:14,895
An airplane toilet

1045
01:45:14,987 --> 01:45:17,603
and in a library.

1046
01:45:18,195 --> 01:45:21,687
I fulfilled one fantasy today.

1047
01:45:23,945 --> 01:45:26,478
Men are selfish.

1048
01:45:26,695 --> 01:45:29,103
They cannot make a woman happy.

1049
01:45:29,153 --> 01:45:31,437
We have to do it ourselves.

1050
01:45:31,570 --> 01:45:33,728
And the principal

1051
01:45:33,862 --> 01:45:36,853
took away my happiness and my husband as well.

1052
01:45:36,945 --> 01:45:38,228
Husband?

1053
01:45:38,278 --> 01:45:39,770
Yes.

1054
01:45:39,778 --> 01:45:42,228
It's always with me.

1055
01:45:42,362 --> 01:45:43,770
It does not talk

1056
01:45:43,987 --> 01:45:46,103
and satisfies me.

1057
01:45:46,362 --> 01:45:48,395
It's the best husband ever!

1058
01:45:50,403 --> 01:45:53,103
Anyway, see you later.

1059
01:46:04,945 --> 01:46:06,562
What happened?

1060
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:08,228
It's Sunday.

1061
01:47:14,528 --> 01:47:15,812
Hello, Grandma.

1062
01:47:15,903 --> 01:47:19,812
- Have you seen the TV remote? - No.

1063
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,145
Where is it?

1064
01:48:24,653 --> 01:48:25,895
Megha!

1065
01:48:27,028 --> 01:48:30,103
Megha! Something has happened to Paras.

1066
01:48:30,653 --> 01:48:33,694
Sandhya! Get the First Aid kit!

1067
01:48:33,695 --> 01:48:35,228
- Hurry up! - Does it hurt?

1068
01:48:35,612 --> 01:48:36,687
Paras!

1069
01:48:36,695 --> 01:48:38,603
- Sit beside me. - Easy, Paras.

1070
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:42,694
Are you all right?

1071
01:48:42,695 --> 01:48:44,944
Forget about her! How did this happen?

1072
01:48:44,945 --> 01:48:48,770
It was my fault, Mom!

1073
01:48:49,153 --> 01:48:52,361
I felt like she needed me.

1074
01:48:52,362 --> 01:48:56,152
I took a rickshaw and asked the driver to hurry.

1075
01:48:56,153 --> 01:48:59,728
And we collided with a bull.

1076
01:49:01,653 --> 01:49:05,603
It's my fault.

1077
01:49:06,112 --> 01:49:09,520
The rickshaw toppled, throwing me out.

1078
01:49:09,903 --> 01:49:11,978
I lost consciousness for some time.

1079
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:17,270
People seek light in the dark

1080
01:49:17,862 --> 01:49:19,687
but all I wanted was you.

1081
01:49:20,278 --> 01:49:21,478
Megha.

1082
01:49:22,028 --> 01:49:23,520
Megha.

1083
01:49:24,028 --> 01:49:27,402
Go get him a glass of water!

1084
01:49:27,403 --> 01:49:28,478
Look over here.

1085
01:49:32,237 --> 01:49:35,728
There it is!

1086
01:49:45,070 --> 01:49:48,062
- Take it easy. - Just blow on it gently!

1087
01:49:58,695 --> 01:50:00,478
Why is this not working?

1088
01:51:39,112 --> 01:51:42,562
- Listen to me... - Not at all!

1089
01:51:42,945 --> 01:51:46,062
Tell me why we should accept her.

1090
01:51:46,695 --> 01:51:51,319
We'll tell our relatives that she's epileptic

1091
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:55,103
to save face.

1092
01:51:58,862 --> 01:52:02,312
Please let's not speak of divorce.

1093
01:52:02,403 --> 01:52:06,103
- I beg you... - There is no need for that.

1094
01:52:10,112 --> 01:52:15,569
We do not want a child from her.

1095
01:52:15,570 --> 01:52:18,103
Enough, Mom.

1096
01:52:18,528 --> 01:52:20,603
This is between us.

1097
01:52:20,903 --> 01:52:24,312
It would be if it happened in the bedroom.

1098
01:52:24,695 --> 01:52:29,187
But, it didn't, and so, it's a family matter!

1099
01:52:29,778 --> 01:52:31,645
I have heard enough!

1100
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:35,895
Don't come home if you can't live without her.

1101
01:52:37,403 --> 01:52:38,687
Goodbye.

1102
01:52:39,653 --> 01:52:43,478
- Listen to me. - I don't want to.

1103
01:53:27,112 --> 01:53:29,770
- Sorry for being late. - It's all right.

1104
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:32,770
I always arrive early.

1105
01:53:32,862 --> 01:53:34,944
It was the annual day program at school.

1106
01:53:34,945 --> 01:53:36,270
How was it?

1107
01:53:36,737 --> 01:53:38,770
Should we get to the point?

1108
01:53:41,695 --> 01:53:42,937
Megha.

1109
01:53:43,362 --> 01:53:45,645
Let's forget what happened.

1110
01:53:46,195 --> 01:53:48,020
We can start again.

1111
01:53:49,528 --> 01:53:52,395
I apologize for what my mom did.

1112
01:53:52,445 --> 01:53:56,353
But I cannot divorce you.

1113
01:53:58,487 --> 01:54:00,562
- It was just a mistake... - Paras!

1114
01:54:02,945 --> 01:54:04,978
I didn't make a mistake.

1115
01:54:06,987 --> 01:54:09,145
What happened was not wrong.

1116
01:54:10,695 --> 01:54:16,895
But it shouldn't have happened there.

1117
01:54:19,862 --> 01:54:22,478
Women desire more than just children.

1118
01:54:35,195 --> 01:54:36,687
So

1119
01:54:38,445 --> 01:54:40,187
What have you decided?

1120
01:54:42,945 --> 01:54:44,812
What do you want to do?

1121
01:54:46,237 --> 01:54:48,812
I don't know.

1122
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:56,562
But for now

1123
01:54:58,987 --> 01:55:01,187
I want some ice cream.

1124
